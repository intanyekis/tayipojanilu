With a career spanning over four decades, she has left an indelible mark on the industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, Reba McEntire released a staggering number of albums, many of which achieved critical and commercial success. Her breakthrough came with the album My Kind of Country in 1984, which featured the hit single "How Blue."</p><p>Reba McEntire's talents extend beyond music into the world of acting. In 2001, she made her mark on television by starring in her own sitcom, Reba. The show ran for six seasons and featured McEntire as a single mother navigating the challenges of life with humor and grace. Her performance earned her critical acclaim and further expanded her fan base.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Reba is currently sitting at nearly 9 figures, with a staggering $95 million net worth.</p><p>Music and acting aside, real estate has played a part in her net worth growth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"In 2003, Reba and Narvel spent $9 million to buy a 2-acre property in Beverly Hills. In 2015, around the time of their divorce, they sold the property – which features a 9,000 square-foot mansion – for $22.5 million. They also owned an 80-acre farm called Starstruck Farm in Gallatin, Tennessee, 30 minutes northeast of Nashville. The property features an 12,800 square-foot lakefront house, large pool, pool house, equestrian facilities and tennis courts. In September 2016 they listed the home for $7.9 million. It languished on the market until July 2017 when it sold for $5 million to a developer," the site reports.</p><p>Things have been coming up aces for decades for Reba, but a divorce changed things around in her personal life.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/reba-mcentire-s-stance-has-changed-about-a-reba-reboot-_i-don-t-think-that-is-ever-going-to-come-to-fruition_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Melissa Peterman Really Felt About Working With Reba McEntire On The Sitcom, Reba</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Melissa Peterman maintained a close relationship with Reba McEntire despite the sitcom coming to an end.</span><h2 id=following-her-divorce-reba-took-control-of-her-finances>Following Her Divorce, Reba Took Control Of Her Finances</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Reba-McEntire.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2015, Reba and her now-ex husband, Narvel Blackstock, separated from one another. Talking to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Reba opened up about her divorce, which changed her personal and professional life.</p><p>"Things started going south with my marriage. Narvel Blackstock, my manager and husband at the time — we got a divorce, and the shocker of it all was, there were four people who were taking care of all my business," she says of the experience. (PEOPLE has an exclusive first listen.) "I had my production manager who left, I had my CEO who left, my manager and husband, and my father had died. So four men who were rock and pillars of my world were gone," she said.</p><p>Because of this massive change, Reba was forced to evaluate her finances, and figure out what to do.</p><p>"I started taking over signing the checks and then I started realizing how much water cost, and the electric bill, and all the things that was going on in my life. I made the money, I brought it home. So it was a huge, huge change for me," she continued.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since the split, Reba has moved on.</p><h2 id=reba-mcentire-was-able-to-move-on-successfully-following-her-divorce>Reba McEntire Was Able To Move On Successfully Following Her Divorce</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/DOlly-Parton-Reba-McEntire-1600792316-1280x850-2.jpg><p>In that same interview, Reba talked about how her faith helped her move on during that trying time.</p><p>"Everything that I was dealing with privately, personally — I had to run it all through God. I had to say, 'OK big boy, I can't handle this. This is way over my pay grade — I don't know what to do.' And I would wait, and He would guide me. And so without my faith, I have no idea where I would be or my career would be, at this time today," she said.</p><p>The selfless star even had some advice for others going through their own personal valleys.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/reba-show.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Reba Made Extra Profits Off Syndication, But A Former Showrunner Claims The Revenue Was Split Unfairly</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>A former Reba employee was seeking over $1 million in damages from her time on the show behind the scenes.</span><p>"If someone walked up to me and said, 'Reba, I'm going through a situation like you did — what's your advice?' I would say, 'Go home, regroup, and listen to see what you're supposed to do next.'
