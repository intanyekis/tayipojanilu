He is a recognized computer programmer and electronics engineer also known under the nickname Woz, who together with <a href=#>Ronald Wayne</a> and <a href=#>Steve Jobs</a> created Apple Inc. Steve is the one who significantly contributed to microcomputer revolution by designing Apple I and Apple II computers.</p><p>So how rich is Steve Wozniak? The person who successfully developed, designed and sold the lines of the first personal computer must be rich. It has been estimated that the overall amount of Steve Wozniak’s net worth is as high as $100 million. His income include a $120,000 annual stipend which he has received since 1987, which was agreed after he gave up his full time employment in Apple Inc.</p><h3>Steve Wozniak Net Worth $100 Million</h3><p>Steve was into electronics from early childhood. He studied at University of California, Berkeley for a year but dropped out with the view of pursuing a career working on the new electronic devices. Woz worked for the multinational information technology company Hewlett-Packard. Then he was introduced to <a href=#>Steve Jobs</a>, who invited Woz to work on the new personal computer Apple, and Woz agreed. Both formed a perfect team in which Steve Wozniak was responsible for the invention, engineering and designing, and Jobs for the marketing. Working in a garage they managed to create a computer which they called Apple I, and founded the company Apple Inc. Business was almost immediately very successful; they quickly became one of the best, and eventually largest computer companies in the world. His net worth rocketed.</p><p>However, Wozniak felt that he wanted to work mainly on engineering, and all those associated management issues were not for him. After several attempts to stay in the company, he left it after 12 years, but despite this fact, the company still increases his net worth every year as long as he receives the particular amount of money as a stipend. More, he is still a shareholder of the company.</p><p>Furthermore, Steve Wozniak could afford to take on various projects after leaving Apple Inc. He made one of his dreams true and started teaching high school students as well as teachers. In addition to this, he founded a universal remote control company called CL9, and the company for wireless GPS technology called Wheels of Zeus. He increased his wealth and popularity by publishing his autobiography “iWoz: From Computer Geek to Cult Icon: How I Invented the Personal Computer, Co-Founded Apple, and Had Fun Doing It” (2006) co-written with Gina Smith.</p><p>More, Woz is invited as the speaker at various events including Science & Technology Summit at the World Forum Convention Center in The Hague (2010), Computer Expo at Earls Court Exhibition Centre in London (2011), Tijuana Innovadora event at the Tijuana Cultural Center, in Tijuana, Mexico (2012) and others.</p><p>Steve Wozniak is a recognised and respected person all over the world. He is the recipient of many awards including the ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award (1979), Isaac Asimov Science Award (2011), the Global Award of the President of Armenia for Outstanding Contribution to Humanity through IT (2011) and others. He is an inductee into the National Inventors Hall of Fame (2000). He has been awarded an honorary doctor of engineering degrees by more than 10 universities, including University of Colorado at Boulder (1989), Kettering University (2005), State Engineering University of Armenia (2011) and others.</p><p>Finally, his personal life has rather stormy, including four marriages. In 1976 he married Alice Robertson: they divorced after four years. From 1981 to 1987, he was married to Candice Clark, and they have three children. From 1990 to 2004, his wife was Suzanne Mulkern. He is now married to Janet Hill (since 2008). Woz has fathered three children.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=15.789473684211><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$100 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 11, 1950 (age 64</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>San Jose, California, United States</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>Profession</td><td>Programmer, Engineer, Entrepreneur, Businessperson, Inventor, Computer Scientist, Scientist, Actor, Film Producer</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Education</td><td>University of California, Berkeley (1986), De Anza College, Homestead High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Janet Hill (m. 2008)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Margaret Louise Wozniak, Francis Jacob Wozniak</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Nicknames</td><td>The Woz , Woz , Stephen Gary Wozniak , Berkeley Blue , Stephen Gary "Steve" Wozniak , Stephan Gary Wozniak</td></tr><tr readability=0.36363636363636><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/SteveWozniak</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36842105263158><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/stevewoz</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.32558139534884><td>Google+</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://plus.google.com/+SteveWozniak</a></td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Dancing with the Stars</td></tr></table><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqyrnq6VYsSwxs2imKRlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./why-the-blacklist-is-coming-to-an-end.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Blacklist Is Coming To An End After 10 Seasons, And Fans Finally Know Exactly Why">&larr;
