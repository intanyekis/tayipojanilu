The pair's seemingly sweet relationship in the 2010s imploded, with Hyland fighting for her life via a restraining order. By the time their relationship ended, Prokop was legally sanctioned from getting close to her, while <a href=#>his Hollywood career suffered a significant decline.</a></p><p>However, years after the former <a href=#>Disney</a> stars ended their relationship, the actress appeared to have found romance in a whole new light, which was in far contrast to her experience with Matt Prokop. Sarah Hyland became romantically involved with reality star Wells Adams, and since they tied the knot, their love life appears to be less dramatic. Here is a look at what appears different in Hyland's marriage to Adams from the past relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sarah-hyland-39-s-marriage-with-wells-adams-years-after-her-relationship-with-matt-prokop>Sarah Hyland's Marriage With Wells Adams Years After Her Relationship With Matt Prokop</h2><p>The Modern Family star went a long way, from enduring abuse in her past relationship to meeting the love of her life on social media. As many loyal Sarah Hyland fans know, her rapport with Wells Adams led to <a href=#>a lovely, star-studded California wedding</a>. However, leading up to this, the couple did not mind showing off tidbits about their dating life. Hyland was smitten way before physically meeting her future husband, as she first saw him on the 12th season of The Bachelorette.</p><p>Since marrying Wells Adams, Sarah Hyland's love life seems calmer and drama-free, compared to the scandalous episodes she endured while dating Matt Prokop. Since tying the knot, Sarah Hyland has been basking in the affection her husband shows her. Three months after their wedding, she made a funny revelation on The Kelly Clarkson Show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sarah-hyland.jpg><p>The star actress shared how she hilariously threatened to discontinue the wedding ceremony if Wells Adams did not shed happy tears while she walked down the aisle. Thankfully, she did not need to carry out that threat because Adams proved to be besotted with his bride. The lovebirds, who don't mind opening up about their home life, had a quick, fun chat with E! News at the 2022 Peoples Choice Awards about their marriage.</p><p>During the conversation, Adams adorably joked about his wife's carefree nature, noting that she "thinks she's a full-blown pop star after a couple of glasses of wine." Besides being goofy, the TV star proved to be a loving partner who enjoys his wife's interests. Hyland gushed to tell People in an interview that he immediately adapted to her love for Disney when they became an item. It is safe to say that Adams swept the Vampire Academy actress off her feet with that adorable act.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sarah-hyland-modern-family-and-ig-photo.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Tragic Truth About Sarah Hyland's Health Issues</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Hyland's battle is an ongoing one.</span><p>Sarah Hyland's husband is also a man of many skills, and this does not exempt the kitchen. Speaking on The Flaky Biscuit podcast, the pair recalled their first date when they first met. Wells <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adams revealed how he flew out from Nashville to Hyland's home in Los Angeles,</a> where he made a special dish for her. The reality personality said, "I cooked for [Sarah] and made [her] shrimp tacos one night and my famous skirt steak recipe tacosâ€¦" Per People, the movie star attested to this by stating:</p><p>"I never had a man cook for me before, so it was really special.

Just three days after he and Sarah Hyland met off social media, she underwent a kidney transplant due to her Kidney dysplasia diagnosis. The Shadowhunters star has a history with the ailment <a href=#>which majorly affected her career</a>. Her first transplant dates back to 2011. Speaking to SELF about her second surgery, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she revealed how Adams showed her much-needed support</a> despite only knowing her for three days. She recalled:</p><p>"He was texting me in the morning before I went into surgery, and we were FaceTiming the entire time I was in the hospital. He's seen me at my worst. He was there through all of that. I think that's why I feel the most beautiful in his eyes, because he still finds me beautiful after seeing all that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The pair connected on Twitter after a flurry of flirty messages. The next fans heard of them was during Halloween in 2016 when they popped up on Instagram dressed as Stranger Things characters. It was unclear at the time if the pair were in a relationship. However, one week later, Sarah Hyland confirmed their romance by making a post captioned, ''He puts up with me." Three days later, Adams gushed over his lover on The Morning Breath Podcast, saying that he was pleasantly surprised to have met her through social media.</p><p>Through 2018, Sarah Hyland and Wells Adams's relationship waxed stronger with some vacations and celebrations of love in between. The Bachelor in Paradise star proved to be a keeper when he defended her from trolls on social media during the pre-Emmy Awards party that year. The radio host and the Scary Movie 5 star got engaged in 2019, and it wouldn't be until 2022 due to the pandemic.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/sarah-hyland-modern-family.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Whatâ€™s Sarah Hyland Been Up To Since â€˜Modern Familyâ€™ Ended?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>It seemed pretty doubtful that Hyland wouldnâ€™t go on to enjoy further favorable outcomes with other projects in Hollywood.</span><p><strong>Sarah Hyland's career profile and net worth according to Celebrity Net Worth:</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>Sarah Hyland</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Birthdate</p></td><td><p>November 24, 1990</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Profession</p></td><td><p>Actor, voice actor</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Career</p></td><td><p>Active since 1997</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Net worth</p></td><td><p>$14 million</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=sarah-hyland-alleged-abuse-in-her-past-relationship-with-matt-prokop>Sarah Hyland Alleged Abuse In Her Past Relationship With Matt Prokop</h2><p>Sarah Hyland and Matt Prokop first met in 2008 when they both auditioned for High School Musical 3.
