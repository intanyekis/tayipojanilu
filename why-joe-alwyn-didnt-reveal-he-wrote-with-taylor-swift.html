Dating from her Reputation album up until her newest album (not including her re-recordings), Evermore. It was a bit of a shock when Taylor revealed that <a href=#>Joe Alwyn actually helped her write some songs for two of her recent albums, Folklore, and Evermore.</a> They have both commented on their songwriting process together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-are-pretty-secretive-about-their-relationship>Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn Are Pretty Secretive About Their Relationship</h2><p>The two started dating in 2016 and kept their relationship off of social media and out of the public eye as much as possible. But with both of them being famous, fans knew. Swift had a secret listening party for her album Reputation, and allegedly <a href=#>admitted to fans that the song Gorgeous was about Alwyn.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Things Taylor Swift Has Done Since She Started Dating Joe Alwyn</a></span></p><p>She has written a lot of other songs about him. Her songs Lover, London Boy, and Invisible String <a href=#>are very obviously written about Alwyn according to fans.</a> Swift revealed that the two decided to keep their relationship quiet in her documentary, Miss Americana, because they both agreed on wanting it to stay private. Especially after all the drama Swift was involved in with Kim and Kanye, it made sense that Swift wanted a lot of her life to stay private after that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the documentary, fans could see a brief glimpse into Swift and Alwyn's relationship. <a href=#>In one scene, Taylor hugs him</a> behind the scenes at one of her shows on tour. But he is never mentioned by name in the documentary. But more recently, the two have been talking about each other to the public and even posting things on social media alluding to their relationship.</p><h2 id=joe-alwyn-co-wrote-songs-with-taylor-swift-for-two-of-her-recent-albums>Joe Alwyn Co-Wrote Songs With Taylor Swift For Two Of Her Recent Albums</h2><p>Joe Alwyn wrote songs under the pseudonym, William Bowery. This was so that fans did not know he was the one who wrote the songs with Taylor. Fans wondered why they were keeping it a secret.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Swift revealed that they wrote the songs, exile,betty, coney island, and champagne problems</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What was also a mystery was why the two wrote such sad songs together rather than romantic ones about each other. Swift said they did this on purpose because they both really enjoy sad songs.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Rare Photos Of Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn Out And About</a></span></p><p>Swift revealed that Joe Alwyn was William Bowery in the Disney Plus special of Folklore: The Long Pond Studios. This special that aired in 2020 featured Swift singing all of the Folklore album and explaining what each song meant and the songwriting process.</p><p>She revealed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"So, William Bowery is Joe Alwyn, as we know...Joe plays piano beautifully, and he's always just playing and making things up and kind of creating things."</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So while Swift revealed that Alwyn was writing songs with her, he didn't comment on it until nearly two years later. Alwyn revealed just exactly why the two kept it a secret.</p><p>He revealed, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">â€œWe chose to do it so the people first and foremost would listen to the music first before dissecting the fact that we did it together."</a></p><p>This made sense to the fans because it gave them the full experience of the song itself before listening to it from the perspective that the two wrote it together.</p><h2 id=what-39-s-in-store-next-for-taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn>What's In Store Next For Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn</h2><p>Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn have been pretty active in their careers lately.

It seems the two have been a lot more open about their relationship and fans love to see it.</p><p>Swift has also recently received an honorary doctorate from New York University and spoke at their 2022 commencement. Fans also think Swift will be releasing a new re-recorded album this summer. Whether that be her 2014 album, 1989, or her 2010 album, Speak Now. Some fans even think she will release both. With both of them being in the public eye, fans are curious and hopeful to see if the two will be even more public about their relationship and share it with their fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>20 Photos Of Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn When They Thought No One Was Looking</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdn7ymecClrrKmXZm2pbrTZqmerpWWuW60xGauq6ekmnq4tdOhZK2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./johnny-lee-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Johnny Lee  Bio (Wiki) ">&larr;
