She gave life to the character making it what it was supposed to be. Rookie Blue was definitely her biggest break.</p><p>But is that the only role she is known for? Definitely not! Okuma is active in the industry for years or let’s say decades. Throughout the years, she won the hearts of many and at the same time, garnered a net worth that will definitely surprise you. So without wasting any more time, let’s see her net worth and who this beautiful woman is married to.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Decent_Bank_Balance></span>Decent Bank Balance<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Most of the TV actors make an average salary, just enough to lead a normal life; however, Okuma makes way more than an average salary. Over the years, she garnered an estimated net worth of <strong>$1 million</strong>; but, that is not the total amount of money she earned.</p><ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex"><li class=blocks-gallery-item><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/45659124274_532f6f17f8_b-1.jpg></li></ul><p>Considering the fact that she made her debut in 1990 and is also a director and a writer, her earning is just a little shy of about <strong>$3 million</strong>. But, due to her expenses, she is just left with a million dollars in her bank account but, who cares, she is still at the top of her game and surely she will earn much more than that in the coming days.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Appearing in Rookie Blue</h3><p>The Canadian actress appeared in the first season of Rookie Blue until the final season of the show making her one of the key characters of the show. She got the opportunity to appear alongside some of the renowned faces on television including<strong> </strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Missy Peregrym (opens in a new tab)" href=#><strong>Missy Peregrym</strong></a>, <strong>Ben Bass</strong>, and <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Devon Bostick (opens in a new tab)" href=#>Devon Bostick</a></strong>.</p><ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex"><li class=blocks-gallery-item><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/325641-1.jpg></li></ul><p>When asked in an interview if she would like to direct an episode of Rookie Blue, she said that she is not ready as the show is big and the cast is famous. She also added that she is writing and would like to direct her own movie.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Movie_Themed_Wedding></span>Movie Themed Wedding<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Enuka Okuma is married to her husband <strong>Joe Gasparik</strong>. They met for the first time in Toronto and became really close friends. At the time they were working together in a crime show. Eventually, they became more than friends and love blossomed between them.</p><p>After more than three years of dating, Joe proposed Enuka during a walk on the beach. Okuma was more than happy as tears of joy started pouring out of her heavenly eyes and she agreed.</p><ul class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-1 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5 is-layout-flex"><li class=blocks-gallery-item><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/854c77b000fc1356fe0868d1bf811e51-1.jpg></li></ul><p>The duo got engaged and after some years, they exchanged their vows on a magnificent wedding which definitely took after a long time on July 2, 2011. Many of their friends advised them to hire a professional wedding planner but they rather did it themselves. Joe’s parents who are florists assisted them at the wedding and so did Enuka’s sister who is a professional graphic designer.</p><p>Their nephews were the ones who carried the rings in a bird’s nest and a ceramic bowl. The wedding reception took place in a theater where many were invited.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/d388e3cd95ea9115e810c89c8675e4f3-1.jpg><p>One of the things that made the ceremony so movie-themed was the movie posters that hung all over the wall and even at the entrance. The three-course food at the wedding was also delicious followed by the beautiful four-leveled chocolate cake made especially for the wedding. The cake featured subtle change in color from white to sage and the icing all over made it more delicious.</p><p>After the wedding, Enuka said that you should enjoy each and every moment of your biggest day. They are still married and have no signs of separation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Surprising_Facts_About_Enuka_Okuma></span>Surprising Facts About Enuka Okuma<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Enuka Okuma voiced <strong>Lady Une</strong> in Mobile Suit Gundam Wing.</li><li>Her name in Nigerian gives a beautiful meaning as ‘gift from Heaven’.</li><li>She is nominated for three Gemini Awards which is the Canadian equivalent of<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" Emmy Award (opens in a new tab)" href=#><span> </span>Emmy Award</a>.</li></ul><p>For more updates, stay tuned to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Celebs Closet</a><strong>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qcpJ%2BosrV6wqikaJ2eqriiec6krKaZXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./leistungsdaten.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sam Tillen - Career stats">&larr;
