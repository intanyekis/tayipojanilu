We always were having fun as a family.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/91620-bradshaw-bunch-main.jpg><p>Rachel, Bradshaw’s eldest daughter from his marriage to Charlotte Hopkins, was previously married to Tennessee Titans placekicker Rob Bironas, who was tragically killed <a href=#>in a 2014 car crash</a> less than six months after the couple tied the knot. Rachel said she was grateful to have her family’s support while opening up about one of the most difficult chapters of her life.</p><p>“After all of that happened, I do talk about that, I’m very real about that, and I quit music because of that and moved back home,” Rachel said.</p><p>“You can see throughout the show just dad helping me really get back on my feet, cause when we started filming, I was like, ‘I do not want to talk about this, I don’t want to talk about that,’ and now it’s like, ‘Why wouldn’t I talk about these things?’ This is my life and everyone that’s close to me knows my struggles with my journey the past six years, and so of course I’m going to talk about it, so it’s just, I wouldn’t have done that though if it wasn’t with my family and my dad there.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>While the show will feature plenty of father-daughter moments — not to mention sweet interactions between Bradshaw and his adorable granddaughter Zurie — boob jobs and dating discussions are on the table<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> in the pilot episode</a>. But as the Pittsburgh Steelers icon shared, he isn’t one to doll out relationship tips.</p><p>“I don’t give dating advice, only after they break up I tell them what I really feel because, I think any father out there that watches the show is going to go, ‘Yeah.’ You don’t dare interfere with matters of the heart, even if you see something that they don’t see, you keep your mouth shut,” Bradshaw said.</p><p>Bradshaw said he would then be “brutally honest” about his feelings should a suitor exit stage left.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/91620-bradshaw-bunch-1.jpg><p>“The girls are automatically going to say, ‘Dad, what did you think about so-and-so?’ I couldn’t stand the guy. I couldn’t stand him, he’s a worm, he’s a punk, he’s no good,” Bradshaw continued.</p><p>“So I mean I was brutally honest with them, but never while they’re dating because if she falls in love with him and marries him, I’m going to fall in love with him, I’ve got to. It’s not about me, it’s about her, and I think as a parent I think that’s going to come across in the show, you’re going to see that it’s funny, but it’s brutally honest and I think the dads out there, I think they’re going to get a kick out of my reaction,” he continued.</p><p>For Bradshaw, he is especially excited that his family will forever have a unique collection of home movies.</p><p>“There will be a time where they perhaps will say, ‘Oh my God, let’s pull out that episode where dad did this,’ and so they’ll always have these fond memories of me and our family together, and that’s the reason I did it, so the girls and I could do something that would be etched in memory,” he said.</p><p>“The Bradshaw Bunch” airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. on E!.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3F7j3Jmam9fqbKzvthmmauZlKi1osOMoqqnrF2Ws7OtyJ1kraddl7JurtGuq5qknK56qbvNnqqtZZmjeq%2Bx1marr2Wjmr%2BqsdJo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tripadvisor-names-uptown-luxury-hotel-iveys-among-best-us.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tripadvisor names uptown luxury hotel The Iveys among best in US  WSOC TV">&larr;
