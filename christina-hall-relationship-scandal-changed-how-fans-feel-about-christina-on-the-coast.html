Flip Or Flop was one of HGTV's biggest hits and part of the draw was seeing the banter between the hosts. Christina has now been divorced twice. After her marriage to Tarek El Moussa ended in 2018, she married Ant Anstead that same year. Unfortunately, that relationship didn't work, either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Christina married Joshua Hall in 2022 and throughout all the changes in her romantic life, she has continued filming her reality series Christina On The Coast. While <a href=#>fans question if Christina On The Coast is real</a>, they also have some opinions about how Christina's ever-changing love life has affected their enjoyment of the show.</p><h2 id=what-do-fans-actually-think-about-hgtv-39-s-christina-on-the-coast>What Do Fans Actually Think About HGTV's Christina On The Coast?</h2><p><a href=#>Christina Hall made good money from her reality show</a>, which began airing on HGTV in 2019. Every episode follows the structure that viewers would expect: a couple or client shares their desire for a more beautiful or more functional home, and Christina shares her design ideas.</p><p>Christina announced season 4 of Christina On The Coast and said Joshua Hall "and I embark on our personal and professional journeys." Redditor @eatthegarganzola started a Reddit thread and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">didn't sound happy about season 4 of the show</a>. The fan wrote, "Sounds like Christina on the Coast is going to be more like a reality show."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/14487358_347348595622065_5282042263424204800_n.jpg><p>As time has gone on, however, it has gotten harder for fans to separate Christina's dramatic personal life from the show that she is filming. And that is because Christina On The Coast often feels like part home renovation show, part regular reality show. Episode 8 of season 1 was called "Wedding Special" and featured Christina and Ant Anstead's wedding. They surprised their friends and family and also were stressed out about moving into a new home in time.</p><p>While it can be fun to learn more about a TV host and get a glimpse into their life, some fans feel that Christina's love life is just too dramatic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Christina Hall And Ant Anstead's Custody Battle For Their Two Year Old Son Has Become Heated</a></span></p><p>Redditor @katiedidkatiedid commented on how Christina has been married three times and commented on how Christina chooses the same colors for each design.</p><p>The fan wrote, "Christina on the Coast: each season features a new husband and the same variation of a kitchen with white oak flooring, white cabinets, white-washed counters/backsplash, and a 'boho' chic design. Yawn."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Christina-Haack-and-Josh-Hall.jpg><p>Redditor @AFXthedude sounds like they would like Christina On The Coast to be about design, not what's going on with Christina. They wrote in the Reddit thread, "If it does focus more on her personal life there's one more show from HGTV I'll be crossing off my list."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans seem to wish that Christina On The Coast could shine a spotlight on home renovation and what choices Christina is making instead of talking about her different marriages.</p><p>Redditor @J_Keezey wrote, "Isn't this supposed to be a design show?" They continued that the show should be named "Christina Redesigned" so it can "play off both the literal redesigns and the redesign of her personal life?"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Christina Hall Keeps Her Marriage Private</a></span></p><p>Fans aren't sure about the spin-off Christina In The Country, either. Redditor @Flaky_Definition_538 said that it feels too similar to Christina's first show. And they didn't like how much money the renovation cost. The fan wrote, "Iâ€™m over the extra large budgets that are literally more than my house ($200k for a reno). Especially given the current economic conditions, it just feels out of touch and unrelatable."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/christina-hall-1.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christina On The Coast has high ratings</a>, however. Even if some viewers are critical of it, they do seem to be watching. According to Discovery.com, many people tuned in both on cable and online, and the HGTV president, Jane Latman, said, â€œChristinaâ€™s long-running success on HGTV is undeniable."</p><h2 id=what-has-christina-hall-said-about-negative-opinions-of-christina-on-the-coast>What Has Christina Hall Said About Negative Opinions Of Christina On The Coast?</h2><p>Christina Hall is likely used to hearing people say that they don't like Christina On The Coast or commenting on her personal life. But that doesn't mean that it's easy for her to continue to hear negative feedback, of course.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened With Christina Haack And Ant Anstead's Marriage?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Christina Hall spoke about backlash she has received and told People that she remembers that she enjoys herself and that she shouldn't want everyone to like her. She said, "I have a great life and I can't be focused on pleasing everyone."</p><p>Christina continued, "I think the older I get, the less I care. I'm approaching 40 in a few months and what I've heard is, in your forties, you're the most confident and comfortable in your own skin."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/christina-hall-smiling.jpg><p>Christina also explained in her interview with People that she does feel bad sometimes, and she makes sure to let Joshua Hall know how she's feeling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Christina said, "I allow myself a little time to be upset, and usually the things that upset me are when people make direct statements about things they have no idea about. Sometimes that'll really irritate me and then I'll talk to [my husband] Josh about it."</p><p>Christina Hall seems to have always had a good attitude about living in the spotlight and hearing feedback from people that she might not always love hearing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/joshua-hall-christina-hall.jpg><p>In 2021, when she was getting ready to launch the third season of Christina On The Coast, Christina told Entertainment Tonight that she wanted to have a good time with her children and travel to Tennessee. Christina now has a home in Franklin, Tennessee, and fixing it up was the subject of her spin-off series Christina In The Country.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In her 2021 interview, Christina Hall told Entertainment Tonight that she likes to think good thoughts when there are changes in her life. She said, "I'm more of a person that just focuses on staying positive. Like, I don't get stuck in dwelling on things if they're going differently. I just always constantly am looking at the future. New projects, new fun activities and everything like that. I guess the main thing is, yeah, just not getting stuck in the setback and just looking at the future."</p><p>Fans might be growing tired of Christina On The Coast, and they may wonder if Christina Hall's personal life will become more stable. However, it seems that Christina is happy and that she's going to keep doing what she loves, which is fixing up and decorating beautiful homes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoaqZqMGqusBmn5qknGK%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF50pyYp5yRoXqktMCnnp6cXZ28uHnFmqWsZZaasq15wJumrqxdmLWztdKtoKeZXaS7bsDHnmScp5GowXA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-long-did-it-take-for-john-legend-whoopi-goldberg-entertainers-to-get-to-egot-status.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Long Did It Take For These Entertainers To Get To 'EGOT' Status?">&larr;
