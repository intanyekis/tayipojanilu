However, much to the disappointment of those fans, the two were clearly never meant to be and ended up breaking up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that this all went down over a decade ago and the pair are still very much in the entertainment industry, this might lead many to question where the pair stand with one another today. Especially given the dramatics of the whole situation and what happened afterward, is there any chance of a Joe Jonas and Taylor Swift reunion any time soon?</p><h2 id=how-old-was-taylor-when-she-dated-joe-jonas>How Old Was Taylor When She Dated Joe Jonas?</h2><p>As far as we're aware, Joe was Taylor's first boyfriend (at least in the public eye) and the pair was about 18/19 years old when they were dating. This is still quite young and given this was during a time when the pair were still dealing with the heights of fame, it's understandable why fans were shipping them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taylor-swift-joe-jonas.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Plus, their fans were still quite young themselves and more than likely were at an age where they were under the impression that relationships last forever, and Taylor is more than proof that this just isn't the case.</p><h2 id=how-long-did-taylor-swift-date-joe-jonas>How Long Did Taylor Swift Date Joe Jonas?</h2><p>Whilst at the time their relationship felt like it lasted forever, it actually only lasted for a few months. It's believed that the relationship lasted between July and October 2008, so only actually spanned roughly three months, so really not that long in the grand scheme of things.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Could Taylor Swift's Overwhelming Fame Have Ended Her Relationship With Joe Alwyn?</a></span></p><p>Fans of the pair will know how things ended as it was a pretty famous and shocking breakup, as Taylor went on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and said how Joe had broken up with her over the phone in 25 seconds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-taylor-and-joe-jonas-friends>Are Taylor And Joe Jonas Friends?</h2><p>Given how long ago the relationship was and how young they both were, a lot can happen in that time. Taylor went through yet another <a href=#>breakup with former boyfriend Joe Alwyn</a> and also allegedly <a href=#>split from her rebound Matty Healy</a>.</p><p>In that time as well, Joe has married Sophie Turner and they are <a href=#>raising their two daughters together</a>. Given that it's more than clear that both Taylor and Joe have moved on from one another, is there any chance that they can mend the rift between them?</p><p>The good news is that, whilst it's highly unlikely that the pair will ever date each other again, they are actually on good terms now. Joe revealed on the 'Armchair Expert' podcast back in May the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">state of his and Taylor's relationship</a> today and stated that they are "cool" with one another.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Taylor Swift Sparks Dating Rumors With NBA Star Austin Reaves After Splitting From Matty Healy</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He also said that any drama that the pair went through is all a thing of the past and that they have finally been able to put it all behind them. Joe also mentioned that he hopes this means he's no longer on the wrong side of Taylor's fans, as "no one f--ks with swifties."</p><p>Given that they've both quite clearly moved on, that might also cause many to question <a href=#>what Taylor's relationship with Joe's wife Sophie looks like</a>â€”or if they even have one. Luckily, the pair seem to have quite a good relationship with one another.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taylor-swift-sophie-turner.jpg><p>This was first seen when the pair appeared on The Graham Norton Show in 2019 together and appeared to get on quite well. Sophie even shared the <a href=#>song that Taylor allegedly wrote about Joe, 'Mr. Perfectly Fine'</a> to her Instagram stories, showing that she has no problem with her husband's ex writing songs about him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This isn't the first time this has happened either, as Sophie also mentioned Taylor's song 'All Too Well' on her Instagram stories and spoke about how good it was. The married couple even attended Taylor's performance of the song on <strong><a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a></strong>, showing that there is clearly no 'Bad Blood' between any of them.</p><h2 id=what-songs-did-taylor-swift-write-about-joe-jonas>What Songs Did Taylor Swift Write About Joe Jonas?</h2><p>Due to how upset she was about the breakup, Taylor did the most Taylor Swift thing possible and wrote a few songs about it. There are many <a href=#>stories behind Taylor's songs</a> and the ones that are supposed to be about Joe are some of her best hits to date.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Were Matty Healy And Taylor Swift Matched Together For Songwriting 'Material'?</a></span></p><p>One of these is her song 'Forever & Always' off her album Fearless. The title is allegedly words that Joe said to Taylor during their relationship, but the song then goes on to call him out on failing to stick to his promise and for dumping her over the phone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the relationship ended 15 years ago, people might assume that Taylor would be over it, but it's not always easy to get over a first love. Many believe that her song 'Invisible String' from her album 'Folklore' is about Joe, as it talks about the past and that she now sends "their babies presents."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taylor-swift.jpg><p>These only go to show that despite her maybe wanting to hide some of the <a href=#>meanings behind her songs</a>, they appear to be much more revealing than she originally intended.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dqa66uM6rZKyvmZvBbq3NnWSjp5Vit7C6wKxkn6qZmruluNhmq6icka58</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./welcome-to-the-2023-tour-dates-of-colter-wall-and-how-to-secure-presale-code-tickets.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Welcome to the 2023 Tour Dates of Colter Wall and How to Secure Presale Code Tickets">&larr;
