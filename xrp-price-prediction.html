XRP (Ripple) is among the four cryptocurrency leaders with <a href=#>Bitcoin</a>, <a href=#>Ethereum</a>, and Tether.</p><p>Ripple has been recording rapid improvement throughout its lifetime, and XRP price has seen substantial growth.</p><p>With such a large market cap, many investors attempt to determine whether the altcoin can grow more this year.</p><p>One of the crypto assets performing great this year to give a seamless payment gateway experience is Ripple.</p><p>Lately, Ripple has launched a new project on its RippleNet called Line of Credit. This project is a beta service that enables Ripple customers to acquire funds easily. Then, they can start financing their cross-border projects using XRP tokens.</p><p>Furthermore, Ripple has currently partnered with Lemonway, a payment gateway in Europe for online marketplaces. This partnership is said to enhance payment transactions between euro-to-euro and other currencies supported by Lemonway.</p><p>Let’s find out would these circumstances be good enough to make Ripple a good investment?<strong> Check our Ripple XRP market analysis</strong> and price prediction below in this article.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Ripple (XRP)</h2><p>Ripple is a privately-held fintech firm that gives a global payment solution through its patented payment network called Ripple Network. Moreover, RippleNet is a payment network built on top of Ripple’s consensus ledger, called XRP Ledger. More so, Ripple supported the innovation of the open-source XRP Ledger.</p><p>Unlike most cryptocurrencies that provide peer-to-peer needs, Ripple was made to combine banks, payment providers and cryptocurrency exchanges, providing real-time settlement expeditions and lower transaction fees.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>History of Ripple (XRP)</h2><p>Before starting with XRP price prediction, Way back in the year 2004, Ripple was founded by Ryan Fugger, who first initialized the Ripple Payment Network. Soon Jed McCaleb and Chris Larson took reigns of this Payment Gateway project in the year 2012, and that is precisely when Ripple formed. Until 2013, Jed McCaleb served as the CTO of Ripple.</p><p>Originally the XRP Ledger was called “Ripple” for how the technology allowed payments to ripple through multiple hops and currencies. The creators chose the ticker symbol “XRP” from the term “ripples” and the X prefix for non-national currencies in the ISO 4217 standard.</p><p>The company registered itself as “Ripple Labs”. Later, to avoid confusion with similar names in 2018, it selected the name for the company and XRP for a digital coin.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Difference between XRP and Bitcoin?</h2><ul><li>The supply of bitcoin is limited, and it depends upon the miners when they release the coin in the market, whereas for XRP, Ripple plans the release of coins in the market. A small contract is used to release XRP in market.<br></li><li>XRP is easy to mine or pre-mined, and it is much cheaper and faster in terms of the transaction. Bitcoin, on the other hand, uses a complicated system of mining. The mining cost and time is taken to mine are higher and it may sometimes take many minutes for transactions to complete.<br></li><li>The Ripple network does the transaction validation of XRP, which uses a unique distributed consensus mechanism to validate transactions. Bitcoin transaction validation requires huge energy requirements, which is not suitable for the climate.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Theoretical Analysis</h2><p>XRP owes resolve several issues faced when using bitcoin like low speed and huge transaction fee. The transaction speed of Ripple is only around 4 seconds, and about 1,500 transactions can be handled hassle-free per second.</p><p>Ripple Labs created 100 billion XRP tokens initially that operate independently from Ripple.</p><p>Thus, Ripple (XRP) is the currency that runs on RippleNet, a digital payment network, which is on top of the XRP Ledger distributed database. The XRP Ledger is open source and is based on distributed ledger technology.</p><p>Since mining involves electric units as the computer systems consume power, this has led to greater exploitation. Thus, Ripple goes the eco-friendly way and is sustainable.</p><p>XRP has been showing rapid progress throughout its lifetime, and its price has seen a substantial improvement. Despite all the odds against Ripple, the altcoin’s price remained less impacted and propelled accordingly. Many experts believe XRP prices are highly undervalued and may grow notably soon.</p><p>As Money exchanges tend to rule a substantial segment in the currency market, nobody has time to muse! Consequently, the rise of XRP turned the tables.</p><p>Moreover, the criticisms on mined assets went to peak earlier this year, which drew so much attention towards this sustainable altcoin. Here is everything about the future currency, the latest buzz and trend patterns you must know!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>XRP Current Market Status as of September 28, 2021</h2><p>As of September 28, today, the XRP price is USD 0.939060 with a 24-hour trading volume of USD 2,708,314,560. XRP is down 2.52% in the last 24 hours. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #6. It has a circulating supply of 46,717,640,571 XRP coins and a max. supply of 100,000,000,000 XRP coins.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/XRP-Price-as-of-september-28.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading>XRP Price Prediction For 2021</h2><p>The price of XRP skyrocketed in 2021, despite the legal battle against the SEC and Ripple’s CEO. Although there has been some excellent news to XRP HODLers, there were rumours about the weak case against XRP.</p><p>The price bounced from $0.2 to more than $0.5 in February and traded above $0.4 until a huge spike rallied the price close to $1 in April. Later, the price eventually hit $1 and reached the yearly highs at $1.9.</p><p>From the end of April to the end of May, the price returned to the lows of $0.77 due to the market crash on May 19. The downtrend continued until July, when the price was trading slightly above $0.60.&nbsp;</p><p>The month of August started with a bullish note. The altcoin broke the $1.00 target for the first time in over 60 days. Despite being armed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit, the company has recently struck a few important deals. Namely, GME Remittance, one of the largest non-bank remittance service providers in South Korea, announced it had joined Ripple’s payment network RippleNet.</p><p>By the end of 2021, being a fast and less costly cryptocurrency, XRP can easily grab many investors. Thereby the price might hit the $2 mark with a bullish market.&nbsp;</p><p>On the contrary, the pre-mined XRP supply can flip the price down. In such a case, the price may decline for a short term near the $0.561 level and may recover within a small time frame.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>XRP Price Prediction 2022</h2><p>XRP price is expected to end the 2021 trade with a bullish note and eventually begin with the new year trade on a similar note. In such a case, the price could hover close to $2 or initiate the trade priced at $1.8 to $1.9.</p><p>If the trend is bearish, the price would remain above $1 or just below. However, the Ripple vs SEC case is expected to drive some outcome in 2022 and as an outcome, most of the exchanges are expected to relist the currency. And in such a scenario, the XRP price would experience an immensely positive impact.&nbsp;</p><p>By the end of 2022, if the series of events occur as predicted, then the possibility of the price hitting a new milestone around its current ATH is high. Moreover, the price could successfully form new highs and range towards $4.</p><p>If the lawsuit has no impact on the price, the normal buying and selling will restrict the price below its current ATH at $3.4</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ripple Price Prediction 2023</h2><p>As per our calculation for long-term realistic XRP price prediction, Ripple price might record price improvement during 2023, as there are many advancements and partnerships in their plan. Ripple (XRP) price might reach somewhere around its previous all-time high at $4.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ripple Price Prediction 2024</h2><p>As per our short and long-term technical analysis and Ripple price prediction, the cryptocurrency price might be around $5 in 2024 as it was built to replace most of the fiat currencies, and if XRP adoption happens, then the coin might reflect a bull run and the XRP price might skyrocket in the long term.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ripple Price Prediction 2024</h2><p>As per our short and long-term technical analysis and Ripple price prediction, the cryptocurrency price might be around $5 in 2024 as it was built to replace most of the fiat currencies, and if XRP adoption happens, then the coin might reflect a bull run and the XRP price might skyrocket in the long term.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>XRP Price Prediction 2025</h2><p>Ripple is also expected to work with more European and Latin American banks to promote XRP and Ripple payment technology. Such advances could lead to significant price changes in the token price of the XRP. This can draw further investors and cause the XRP price to march towards the set target initially at $5 and later at $10.&nbsp;</p><p>If the market is subjected to a crash in the next five years as it did, the price can reduce to approximately 50% and see its low at $3.513.</p><p>However, suppose Ripple manages to carry over the persisting investors by maintaining a steady network and tops as a cheap exchange medium by the end of the next five years. In that case, the price may be seen at an average figure of $5.742</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Experts Says About XRP price prediction for 2021?</h2><p>The SEC case hasn’t been solved yet. And if, before, it had a dramatic effect on the XRP price, now, the situation is not so obvious.</p><p>At the end of 2020, the XRP price fell to a local minimum of $0.17 while the SEC case was gaining momentum. At the beginning of April 2021, the XRP value renewed its three-year high at $1.11 while the court allowed the company to review the internal documents of the SEC.&nbsp;</p><p>On May 4, Ripple plunged as the SEC threatened XRP holders with legal action. The Commission opposes investors to join the XRP securities recognition case. Nevertheless, the fall didn’t continue for long, as the company appointed a former US treasurer to its board.&nbsp;</p><p>How should investors behave in such uncertain circumstances? Is Ripple expected to rise or fall? Look at experts’ predictions.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Wallet Investor</h3><p>The average price of the XRP will fluctuate below $1 until December when the rate will touch $1.075. Although the website doesn’t predict a strong uptrend, the average price stays at reasonable levels.</p><p>The highest price will already break above $1 in September. The minimum rate won’t fall below $0.30. However, the difference between the low and high price signals increased volatility.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>TradingBeasts&nbsp;</h3><p>TradingBeasts expects the average XRP price to stay within a $0.82-0.85 range.</p><p>The website sees an uptrend, which is a good sign for traders. Still, the rise will be limited. The maximum price will reach $1.067 in December 2021. The minimum price won’t fall below $0.7039 (August 2021).</p><p>The website significantly reviewed the XRP outlook. Previously, the maximum value was expected to move above $2.20.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Coin Price Forecast</h3><p>This website also projects an uptrend for the XRP/USD pair. According to Coin Price Forecast, the price may reach $0.83 by the end of the year. The forecast was reviewed. Just recently, the platform expected XRP to skyrocket to $5.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Crypto Ground</h3><p>The Ripple forecast of Crypto Ground can’t be called promising. Still, the upward movement will prevail. By 2022, the price will reach $1.008.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Long Forecast</h3><p>Below, you can check the Ripple coin price prediction by the Economy Forecast Agency. The source expects a downtrend. The price of the XRP/USD pair will suffer ups and downs. At the end of the year, the price will close at $0.45.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ripple, A Good Investment?</h2><p>Risks of regulatory tightening will be essential for the crypto market in the coming year. Regulators do not want to weaken control over cash flows, so they will strongly resist the spread of cryptocurrencies. The influence of this factor will be even more potent than back in 2017–2018. The impact of this factor may grow due to the active development of digital currencies by central banks. The expected growth of DeFi is another risk for Ripple.</p><p>Oddly enough, the coronavirus pandemic can support the virtual market. So far, there is no reason to expect an early end to the pandemic, so the demand for cryptocurrency and XRP will remain quite high. If the dominant driving force in the market had previously been individuals, then in 2021, it is institutions. Therefore, next year we will most likely see a smooth rise in the XRP coin. Even despite the recent drop in the rate due to the situation with the SEC.</p><p>April to June 2021 confirmed that the XRP/USD pair still has major speculative characteristics. The pair still produces volume and volatility. The XRP showed it could triple its capacity, then lose almost everything. It’s a good point for aggressive traders.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDE0alkqaqZmLJuvNGem6KbpJ68r3s%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./anas-sefrioui-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anas Sefrioui Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr;
