Entertainment reported on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">proceedings leading up to the decision</a> on Pacino's child support.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the outlet, Pacino engaged the services of a private judge, at a cost of nearly $1,000 an hour.</p><p>Yahoo! obtained and quoted documents related to the judge's fees to mediate the case:</p><p>... The professional fee ($950/hr) applies to mediation proceedings within Los Angeles County. For information on travel rates, please contact the Case Administrator. A half-day session includes up to four (4) hours of hearing time and up to one (1) hour of preparation time.</p><p>A full day session includes up to eight (8) hours of hearing time and up to two (2) hours of preparation time. Any additional time is billed at the applicable hourly rate ...</p><p>In total, Al Pacino <a href=#>has four children including Roman</a>, who is under six months old. Roman was born in June.</p><p>Pacino also has twins (who are 22) with actress <a href=#>Beverly D'Angelo</a>, as well as a daughter named Julie Pacino, who is 33.</p><p>Pacino's own father abandoned his family when the actor was a toddler. In 2014, Pacino expressed his commitment to be a present parent to his children, and explained:</p><p>"I consciously knew that I didn’t want to be like my dad ... I wanted to be there.</p><p>"I'm responsible to them. I'm a part of their life. When I'm not, it's upsetting to me and to them. So that’s part of the gestalt."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As such, it stood to reason Pacino was amenable to the $30,000 child support obligation, despite the fact it was arranged through courts and mediating judges.</p><p>News <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">of the decision was initially reported</a> by the New York Post's gossip column Page Six on November 2nd; the paper claimed it obtained documentation detailing the decision.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tristan-thompson-accused-of-not-paying-40-000-a-month-in-child-support-by-son-s-aunt.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Tristan Thompson Accused Of Not Paying $40,000 A Month In Child Support By Son's Aunt</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Tristan was reportedly ordered to pay his ex $40,000 a month in 2019, but he now seems to be failing on his child support duties.</span><p>According to Page Six, Pacino and Alfallah would maintain "joint legal custody" over son Roman, with Alfallah having "primary physical custody" of their son.</p><p>With regard to the arrangement's finer details – and expenses above and beyond the $30,000 monthly base obligation – the outlet added:</p><p>A Los Angeles judge further ordered the “Scarface” star to pay Alfallah $110,000 upfront before continuing with the monthly payments, $13,000 for a night nurse, and cover any medical bills outside of health insurance coverage.</p><p>Not only that but Pacino has been ordered to make a yearly $15,000 deposit into an education fund for his youngest son [Roman].</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on that reporting, it appeared Pacino's $30,000 child support per month did not cover a number of primary expenses.</p><p>Additional stipulations included a six-figure "upfront" sum paid to Alfallah, as well as arrangements for medical expenses and education (both of which are standard elements of most formal child support arrangements).</p><p>Page Six quoted Pacino as saying Roman's birth was a "miracle." Pacino said all of his children were important to him, but Roman's arrival was "really special coming at this time," presumably a reference to his octogenarian status.</p><p>For her part, Alfallah did not seem to mind partners with whom she has a large age gap. Vanity Fair reported on the ruling, noting that Alfallah previously dated Mick Jagger.</p><p>After breaking up with Jagger, Alfallah said:</p><p>The heart doesn’t know what it sees, it only knows what it feels. It was my first serious relationship, but it was a happy time for me.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finally, Al Pacino's $30,000 child support arrangement wasn't the only matter addressed in the decision. According to People.com, the couple jointly agreed to "facilitate contact ... between the non-custodial parent and Roman when Roman is in her/his custody until such time as Roman is able to engage in such contact on his own."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmmqRdpa6ktc2oZJygmaGxbr%2FUqaeoqqRigHF8j2lm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jared-leto-makes-april-fools-day-cameo-on-wheel-of-fortune.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jared Leto Hosts Wheel of Fortune in April Fools Day Prank">&larr;
