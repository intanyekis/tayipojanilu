In its first year on the market, the game sold approximately 300,000 copies. Because it is a simulation, there are numerous endings to the game, and each decision counts.</p><p>You’ll have to start over if you make an incorrect move. However, with the assistance of a guidebook, you may finish the game quickly. To access all of House Party’s secrets, scroll down below.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=house-party-rachel-guide></span>House Party Rachel Guide<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Listed below are the steps for the Rachel Guide:</p><li>You should introduce yourself the first thing you do when you visit Madison.</li><li>You should go over the conversation until you finish it and make sure that you’ve done everything correctly. Then, after greeting Rachel, choose the option “Nice to meet you,” “discuss Madison,” and finally, “it’s a video game.” After that, say something like, “Are you having a good time at the party?”</li><li>Start a conversation with Frank about stealing from Rachel; you’ll need to check her thermos in order to win his confidence.</li><li>Open the refrigerator and take a sip to discover the coffee.</li><li>Take the stove from the pantry cupboard, next to the refrigerator. You may remove the kettle and place it on the highest ring visible on the stove by hitting (CTRL). Then make yourself a cup of coffee and turn on the stove after that.</li><li>Drink as much alcohol as you can until the coffee is finished; in the cupboard behind Frank, you’ll find more booze.</li><li>Pick up the natty light that’s tucked away under the solitary chair beside the window where Frank is.</li><li>In the study, look for a fireplace with speakers on top. Go to the right speakers and take it, then pull it down. Another neat light may be found here.</li><li>Head to the kitchen and garage, where you’ll find another natty lite next to a blue box on a shelf. Take it.</li><li>If you encountered Patrick when going upstairs, introduce yourself and volunteer to help.</li><li>Another natty light on the top shelf beside the bathroom door is decorative.</li><li>To obtain the painkillers, you must pass through the master bedroom, and as soon as you open the bathroom door, close it behind you to avoid being seen. Take the pills that were found atop a basket in a corner of the room.</li><li>Go to the bathroom and gather a basket, which you’ll lower for another natty lite. You’ll discover what you’re looking for behind it. For the time being, ignore the kettle’s whistling noise.</li><li>Get another natty lite by going to Brittney’s room and searching for a laptop on the left-hand side of the desk, as well as a bottle.</li><li>Toss the coffee into a cup, then back to the kitchen. Make sure the stove is turned off before leaving.</li><li>Give Patrick the drugs he wants and ask for a favour: his phone. Brittney is where you’ll find it.</li><li>Introduce yourself to Brittney and get Patrick’s phone number.</li><li>Find Patrick and tell him to return his phone, making sure to mention his inebriation.</li><li>Inform Patrick about Frank’s wine bottle. Now go to Frank and tell him about Patrick; a fight will occur, and grab Patrick’s bottle of wine as soon as he drops it.</li><li>Give Frank all of your natty lites and tell him to sniff the thermos while you sniff the silver thermos and tell Frank it has water. Frank will then hand it on to you.</li><li>Tell Patrick that the coffee he’s drinking is Irish coffee, and watch him sober up.</li><li>“Tell her you’re not afraid of Frank, look at these biceps,” you remark as you hand the thermos back to Rachel. Just make sure Frank isn’t in the vicinity.</li><li>Ask Rachel if she’s nervous, and she’ll respond with “believe me” and “that’s wonderful.” You can now inquire about Rachel’s phone number.</li><li>When Patrick returns, tell him to get his phone from Brittney and take it from him.</li><li>You can now ask Madison for Vickie’s phone number. To make this happen, you must first trick Ashley by untying her top, and then Madison will give you the phone number.</li><li>Make sure Madison is in the room when you sneak behind Ashley and unhook her top without her noticing. You can obtain Vickie’s contact information.</li><li>You can now discuss phone hacking and falsified messages with Katherine. Follow her to the room with a laptop and hand over Patrick’s phone.</li><li>Choose the option to send texts to Rachel first, then to Vickie.</li><li>Select the messages in the following order: “tell cute guy about wet dream,” “wait for Rachel to come and chat to you,” and “tell cute guy about wet dream.” Wait for it to happen by selecting the fake text option that says “take your shirt off.” When the internet goes down, you can locate it on the top shelf of the study room’s cabinet. Turn it off and then back on again.</li><li>When the internet is back up, send her another hoax text: “flash the cute boy.” Find Rachel and follow her outside, then select “dancing in your bi” from the dialogue option “how her buddy knows you.” When she’s finished dancing. “Get nked for cute guy for 30 seconds,” use bogus texts once more. Follow her outside now. Request that Katherine send you a bogus text message saying “get n*ked and tch herself,” and then hide in the spare room closet until she’s finished.</li><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=house-party-ashley-game-guide></span>House Party Ashley Game Guide<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>If you don’t want to take Madison’s Blackmail option, you may instead choose Ashley and earn street bonuses. Here are the instructions for completing it.</p><li>After Step 14 in the Madison Guide, you’ve been entrusted with her clothes by Ashley.</li><li>Take the clothes with you to the laundry room. It’s on the other side of the house from where you’re washing the laundry. Go down to get some sod from the fridge while your clothing is being washed.</li><li>Retrieve the clothes from the washing machine and give them to Ashley.

Never in a million years would I have thought.</li><li>Frank was inspecting you.</li><li>So, what’s the storey with you and Madison?</li><li>Collect the mystery key next to the white vase on the left side of the fireplace. Look on the left shelf as you enter the garage for the bathroom key.</li><li>Upstairs, the first door on the right is the Master Bedroom. Look for Madison’s phone beside the sink in the bathroom, which is the first door on the left.</li><li>Brittney is in the room next to the Bunk Bed room. Introduce yourself and then have a look around the area around the laptop. Gather the scrap of paper.</li><li>Return to the master bedroom, where there is a table adjacent to the bed. It’s in the corner, and it’s framed by a mirror. Look for a gastronomy book and a pencil to use on the paper.

But there’s a catch: you can only open the safe when no one else is around.</li><li>Return Madison’s phone and speak with her about Brittney.</li><li>Make sure you and Madison are alone in the room before approaching Madison with your prize request.

Make Rachel believe she doesn’t have to be afraid of Frank, and make sure you’re not being eavesdropped on by him.
