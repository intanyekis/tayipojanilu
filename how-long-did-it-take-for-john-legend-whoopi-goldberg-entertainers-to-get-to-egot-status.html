Bagging all of the four awards gives an entertainer an all-knew status, and places them in books of history, since not so many get to achieve the feat. In fact, only 16 out of millions of entertainers have been able to get to EGOT status since the inception of these awards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Most Recent Celebs To Win An EGOT</a></span></p><p>For someone to reach <strong>EGOT</strong> status, there has to be a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, and the long process can take years to finally accomplish. This is how long it took some EGOT title holders to cross the finishing line and finally cement their names as super entertainers.</p><h2 id=john-gielgud-30-years><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>John Gielgud (30 Years)</span></h2><p>Gielgud’s journey to becoming an EGOT title holder began in 1948 when he bagged a Tony Award for The Importance of Being Earnest. 31 years later he would get his first Grammy, for Ages of Man, that earned him a Best Spoken Word, Documentary, or Drama Recording. In 1981, he won the Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Arthur, and finished his run 10 years later, with an Emmy for Summer’s Lease.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Whoopi Goldberg And Other Stars Who Are EGOT Winners</a></span></p><h2 id=alan-menken-30-years><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Alan Menken (30 Years)</span></h2><p>Not only is Alan Menken an EGOT holder, but, of all winners, he’s the one with the most Academy Awards, and only second to Alfred Newman when it comes to Grammys. Menken’s road to EGOT status began in 1990, with an Academy Award for The Little Mermaid. A year later, he got a Grammy for the same. In 2012, he won a Tony for Best Original Score for Newsies, and in 2020, he finally got his Emmy for Rapunzel’s Tangled Adventure.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Top 10 All-Time Grammy Winners Ranked According To Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scott-rudin-28-years><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Scott Rudin (28 Years)</span></h2><p>Scott Rudin goes down as the one with the second most total number of awards, having a record of 20 awards to his name.

Rogers has a total of six Tony Awards for his compositions that include ‘South Pacific’ and ‘The King and I’. Not only is Rogers an EGOT winner, but he also has a Pulitzer Prize that makes him the only one with a PEGOT status.</p><h2 id=rita-moreno-16-years><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Rita Moreno (16 Years)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Born in 1931, actress Rita Moreno first received her Academy Award in 1962 for the Best Actress in a Supporting Role, following her appearance in the film West Side Story.
