The show, which debuted to a record-breaking 14.95 million average viewership, stars James Spader as Raymond "Red" Reddington, a former U.S. Naval Intelligence officer turned high-profile criminal, who surrenders to the FBI with an offer to help catch some of the world’s most dangerous and elusive criminals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For ten years, the show has kept viewers on the edge of their seats with its intricate plot lines, intense action sequences, and <a href=#>unexpected twists and turns</a>.

Despite these changes, the show has remained one of NBC’s top-performing shows and maintained a loyal fan base.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, viewership has been declining steadily in recent years, with season 9 accruing an average of 4.77 million viewers; a number that pales in comparison to season one’s 14.95 million.

In 2017, NBC greenlit the spinoff, The Blacklist: Redemption, which followed Tom Keen (Ryan Eggold) as he discovered more about his past. However, despite having the trappings of success, the show performed dismally, debuting to just 4.3 million viewers and an unimpressive 0.8 demo rating. With this in mind, it’s quite unlikely that NBC will be reviving any of the storylines or characters from The Blacklist after its finale.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though a spinoff is unlikely, fans have been speculating on what kind of storylines might be ideal should NBC have a change of heart.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> “Could the show just go on and be about Red and Dembe doing criminal things</a>,” one Redditor theorized in 2021. “It could literally go anywhere and do anything and not be tied to Katarina or keen or the FBI.
