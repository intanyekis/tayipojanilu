Some of their most successful releases since then have been with Star Wars: The Bad Batch, The Book of Boba Fett, and 2022's Andor, but there's still many characters and stories fans want told - deserving of their own show on Disney+.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From villain backstories to fan favorite characters getting more screen time, here are 8 Star Wars characters that fans think deserve their own show on the platform.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Does The Original Star Wars Cast Really Feel About The Disney Sequels And Shows?</a></span></p><h2 id=ben-solo><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Ben Solo</span></h2><p>Perhaps the most popular character to come out of the recent Disney Star Wars trilogy, Kylo Ren/Ben Solo is one of the most beloved characters in all of Star Wars - yet Disney left many fans upset with his fate at the end of Star Wars: TheRise of Skywalker and feel his return would right many of the wrongs of the trilogy. Kylo Ren's redemption arc into turning back to the light as Ben Solo was a highlight of the series, but Ben was only given a few minutes on screen in a way that felt like a tease to the audience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans would love to see Adam Driver return to the role and explore the light side, but there's also the potential to follow his childhood with his parents Han and Leia. Regardless of how Disney would choose to approach Ben Solo in a series, many fans are begging he's at least given a chance.</p><p>Related:<span class=related-single><a href=#>'Star Wars': Here's Why Adam Driver Might Come Back As Kylo Ren</a></span></p><h2 id=revan><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Revan</span></h2><p>With rumors of an appearance in the upcoming Star Wars: The Acolyte series and a few mentions in the film series, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Revan</a> is one of the most popular characters from Star Wars that has never been featured in live action or an animated show. He was one of the most feared Sith Lords after leaving the Jedi Order and was the namesake of The Revan Legion in Star Wars Legends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After seeing appearances of some other noteworthy dark side villains like The Grand Inquisitor in Obi-Wan Kenobi, many viewers are curious to see which villain will grace their screens next - and Revan is at the top of many of their lists.</p><h2 id=cal-kestis><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Cal Kestis</span></h2><p>It isn't often that a video game character is so beloved that fans would like to see their debut in live action, but fans of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order are desperate to see Cal Kestis show up in his own show or movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cal is one of the most likable Star Wars protagonists, as a surviving Jedi of the purge that wiped out most of the Jedi Order. He also has one of the most lovable droids at his side in the form of BD-1 - which many fans thought they spotted as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a cameo</a> in an episode of The Book of Boba Fett. Having been modeled after and voice acted by actor Cameron Monaghan, a Disney+ show would already have the perfect actor lined up for the job.</p><h2 id=qui-gon-jinn><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Qui-Gon Jinn</span></h2><p>While the <a href=#>prequel series</a> divided many fans, there's been a new appreciation for the films of late and one of the most memorable characters came in the form of Obi Wan's Jedi Master, Qui-Gon Jinn. Fans latched onto Liam Neeson's portrayal of the wise Master and were elated to see his small cameo at the end of the Obi-Wan Kenobi series, but they'd love to see more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A Disney+ show could explore his earlier days starting out in the Jedi Order and his growth from Padawan to Master, giving even more insight into his character and how he formed such a close bond with Obi-Wan and why he was so protective over young Anakin.</p><h2 id=darth-maul><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Darth Maul</span></h2><p>Star Wars has truly knocked it out of the park with the characters in the dark side, but one of their greatest characters first appeared in the prequel trilogy in the form of <a href=#>Darth Maul</a>. After exciting fans with his appearance and unusual lightsaber, his quickly extinguished role in the prequels left fans visibly upset, which was largely rectified in both of Star Wars greatest animated shows, <a href=#>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a> and Star Wars Rebels, fans just can't help wanting to see more of Maul's tragic story unfold.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After being teased with a cameo at the end of The Solo: A Star Wars Story with original performer Ray Park and reports that he was originally going to be the main villain of the sequel trilogy, fans keep wondering what could have been and are begging Disney to see the possibilities at hand.</p><h2 id=asajj-ventress><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Asajj Ventress</span></h2><p>With one of the most tragic and intriguing backstories in all of Star Wars, Asajj Ventress piqued everyone's interest in the animated Star Wars: The Clone Wars and appeared in numerous <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Star Wars novels</a>. This Dathomirian's life took her from being a slave, Jedi Padawan, Sith assassin, and Nightsister, to a bounty hunter with conflicted world views.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At times villain and at others an anti-hero, she's interacted with some of the most iconic characters like Count Dooku, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Ahsoka Tano, but she deserves to be discussed on her own and not always in relation to another great character. Few female characters from the dark side have ever been given much screen time, and we think it's about time they did.</p><h2 id=mace-windu><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Mace Windu</span></h2><p>Another one of the most popular Jedi in the prequel series, Mace Windu is another character that would benefit from a Disney+ show. Like Qui-Gon, exploring his childhood and early days with the Jedi Order would give great context to how the Jedi High Council came to be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are rumors that a Mace Windu series is in the works, but right now there's not much backing up these claims. However, his animated counterpart did recently appear in the first season of the Tales of the Jedi anthology miniseries alongside Count Dooku.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> Star Wars Fan Theory: Did Mace Windu Know Anakin Killed Count Dooku All Along?</a></span></p><h2 id=general-grievous><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>General Grievous</span></h2><p>While often joked about, General Grievous is one of the more intriguing characters in Star Wars canon with a cult-like following, having appeared in Star Wars: Clone Wars and Revenge of the Sith.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Exploring his haunting backstory that has often been depicted as that of a Kaleesh whose planet had been targeted and enslaved, and the cold-hearted warrior that was born from such treatment could be one of the darkest stories portrayed in all of Star Wars media. Fans would love to see his transformation from this ruthless warrior to the Jedi hunting cyborg he became.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrZmiYsSivtJmmqGZopawtbHRrGSwoJ9is6K60maroaGeoHqlsdKeqa%2BdXam1prXRZqawpl2ZtrS6xLJkrKCfrHw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./taylor-swift-fans-are-so-powerful-they-cause-earthquakes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Taylor Swift Fans Are So Powerful They Cause Earthquakes">&larr;
