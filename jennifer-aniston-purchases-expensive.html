Since her role as Rachel on the hugely successful television program Friends, people have watched everything Aniston does, from her relationships, purchases, and suspected pregnancies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While not one to be overly flashy with her money, there are many things that Jennifer Aniston treats herself to. And who wouldn't with an income like hers? She has been spotted regularly at exotic locations around the world, living it up with close friends. While she treats herself to the occasional bit of luxury, Aniston is also known for her charitable work as well, which is quite commendable. Here are 10 of the most ridiculously expensive things Jennifer Aniston has bought.</p><h2 id=rolex-day-date---34-000>Rolex Day Date - $34,000</h2><p>The epitome of wealth - a Rolex watch. Most people with sizeable bank accounts have at least one of these prestigious watches, and Jennifer Aniston is no different. She purchased this beautiful piece sometime in 2008, although it has been noticed on her wrist more often recently.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Most Expensive Rolex Watches That Money Can Buy</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While not one to flash a lot of bling like some celebrities, Aniston has been spotted wearing this gorgeous watch several times recently. This is not any ordinary Rolex either (is there even such thing as an ordinary Rolex?) but one of their pricier pieces, and Aniston is quite proud to show it off.</p><h2 id=honeymoon-in-bora-bora---4-000-night>Honeymoon In Bora Bora - $4,000/night</h2><p>When you're embarking on a new marriage, you want to celebrate in style! Most honeymoons are fairly exquisite, with couples spending a small fortune on the location as well as the accommodations.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Most Luxurious Honeymoon Destinations</a></span></p><p>Jennifer Aniston is no different. Following her marriage to Justin Theroux, the couple enjoyed a honeymoon in Bora Bora. The Polynesian island offers resorts like the Four Seasons, where couples can rent villas for anywhere between $4,000 - $12,000 per night. They also needed to get to the island, and a private jet would cost around $250,000 round trip. A luxurious honeymoon indeed!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=porsche-panamera---100-000>Porsche Panamera - $100,000</h2><p>When you're in love, you want to show it however you can. People often buy their significant others gifts as a way of showing their love and adoration. Those with larger bank accounts opt for larger and fancier gifts, of course.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>20 Celebrity Gifts That We Wouldn't Even Buy If We Could</a></span></p><p>Just before their wedding, Aniston purchased a Porsche Panamera for her hubby-to-be, Justin Theroux. The fancy sports car would have cost her approximately $100,000, and that's before any of the bells and whistles were added on to the car.</p><h2 id=beauty-products---140-000-year>Beauty Products - $140,000/year</h2><p>Known as one of the most beautiful people of all time, Jennifer Aniston has kept her youthful appearance by taking good care of herself. While she does not believe in following any fad diets, she maintains a healthy diet of nutritious foods, while drinking lots of Smart Water, a product that she not only consumes but also endorses.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Most Valuable Cosmetics Brands In The World</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another way that Aniston maintains her beautiful looks is by investing in high-quality beauty products. It is estimated that she spends around $140,000 on beauty products every year. Not in her lifetime, but every year. That is some top quality face cream!</p><h2 id=bentley-continental-gt---214-000>Bentley Continental GT - $214,000</h2><p>Another sign of wealth is your choice of ride, of course. Many celebrities show off their elite status by purchasing not just one but several fancy cars to line their driveways. While Jennifer Aniston doesn't own a whole line of cars, she does possess a couple of very nice and very chic cars.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Wealthiest Car Companies In The World</a></span></p><p>She has been seen cruising around town in her Bentley Continental GT, which would have cost her around $214,000. This car comes with every fancy feature you can imagine, including a 6.0L twin turbo engine that can reach top speeds of 205.7mph.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jean-roy-re-polar-bear-sofa---754-000>Jean Roy√®re Polar Bear Sofa - $754,000</h2><p>Every now and again, it's nice to splurge on something really fancy, and not a little ridiculous in price. When Jennifer was furnishing her Bel Air home, she purchased a beautiful Jean Roy√®re polar bear sofa for a mere $754,000. Yes, her sofa costs more money than most people's homes.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Top Ten Most Expensive Furniture In The World</a></span></p><p>These sofas by the French designer are the latest rage among celebrities, with Kanye West and Ellen DeGeneres also own one.

While she doesn't live in any of the homes very often, jetting all over the world depending on what project she's working on, she enjoys having beautiful homes in a variety of locations.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Reasons Why NYC Is The Greatest City In The World</a></span></p><p>Recently, she purchased a stunning 3-bedroom apartment in New York City, overlooking Gramercy Park.
