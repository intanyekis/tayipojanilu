He's been busy since he appeared on the music scene in 2008 when he was rolling out hit album after hit album. Add some rap beefs and a child with <a href=#>his baby mother Sophie Brussaux</a>, and you have a pretty consuming life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Drake Follows Ben Shapiro's Sister Abby On Instagram, Is This The Real Reason Why?</a></span></p><p>Last year, however, Drake was really occupied with music. <a href=#>Drake surprised fans with his experimental album 'Honestly, Nevermind'</a> before his collaboration Hip-Hop album 'Her Loss' with fellow rapper 21 Savage. It seems that Drake has been balancing his personal family life with his artistic life, and it's continued to pay off well for him. He has a new hobby, however, that isn't related to his usual endeavors.</p><p>Drake's been busy with his newfound love of gambling. He's put millions on millions of dollars into this hobby, which has fans begging multiple questions. Why is a multi-millionaire like Drake so invested in betting, and just how much has he put into this hobby? Here's everything to know...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=everything-to-know-about-drake-39-s-net-worth-now>Everything To Know About Drake's Net Worth Now</h2><p>It shouldn't be surprising that Drake has made a LOT of money. He's one of the highest-selling music artists of all time, and he's invested in numerous avenues of wealth outside of music. With platinum songs such as 'Best I Ever Had' and 'One Dance', Drake has no reason not to be extraordinarily wealthy. <a href=#>Drake has been accused of "riding artist's waves" before</a>, but no one knows what to do with raw talent better than the new King of Rap, which is clearly shown in Drake's financials.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Other Celebrities Have Said About Working With Drake</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drake reportedly has a net worth of $250 million</a>. It's crazy to think how Drake got to be so rich and famous. That's especially considering that Drake earned most of his money from singing and rapping, instead of his original claim to fame, his pursuit of acting. A lot of people either don't know or they forget that Aubrey Graham was once an actor on Degrassi, playing the minor role of the wheelchair-bound Jimmy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/drake-with-a-huge-smile.jpg><p>In addition to Drake's rap income, he also has numerous investments in various ventures. These include his personal brand and music label October's Very Own, which has competed intensely with other streetwear labels such as Yeezy and Supreme. He also has sponsorships with the NBA's Toronto Raptors (which is exclusively partnered with OVO), as well as the mega-corporations Nike and Apple.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/drake.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from Drake's business investments and gambling spending, he puts most of his money into real estate. According to Wealthy Gorilla, Drake purchased a $7.7 million mansion in the Hollywood Hills. He has a long list of other properties spanning around the world, some of which aren't even in North America.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Drake Shelled Out Millions Of Dollars In Order To Keep Being A Terrible Celebrity Neighbor</a></span></p><p>Perhaps Drake's most luxurious purchase is his personal Boeing 767 jet. One of the most expensive personal planes in the world, it's valued at $185 million. Drake himself explained this when he gave a tour of the jet for an exclusive Youtube video.</p><h2 id=drake-has-wagered-around-1-billion-in-gambling>Drake Has Wagered Around $1 Billion In Gambling</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drake has participated in an astounding total wager of $1 billion.</a> He's won some for sure, but he's definitely lost a fair share of money as well. Here's exactly what he's bet on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This all started in 2022, when world-famous gamblers started speaking about Drake's crazy bets that they saw first-hand. One of those bettors, Bill Krackomberger, told the NY Post that casino marketing departments are obsessed with the 'Hotling Bling' crooner. Bill claimed that Drake was "in-demand". Bill himself saw Drake bet $200,000 on just one roulette spin, but Bill's not the only one spot Drake betting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/drake-adonis-and-sophie-brussaux.jpg><p>Drake once posted a video of him winning a million on a roulette spin to his Instagram story. Another time, Drake and French Montana were spotted together betting at a Vegas roulette table, and a video of them betting went viral on social media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Drake.jpg><p>Drake has also bet a large amount of money on professional sports. This has been noted for years, sometimes with private stories coming out, but more often than not it's Drake showcasing his sports betting to social media.</p><p>The physical sport of UFC fighting has become a magnet for bettors, and Drake hasn't held back. He famously won $1 million after a fight involving Israel Adesanya, who Drake personally bet on. Drake bet over $200,000 on the fighter to win, meaning he won $800,000. Considering that Israel was favored to win to begin with, that's a pretty good return on investment for Drake.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps Drake's most famous bet was for the 2022 Super Bowl featuring the Los Angeles Rams and the Cincinnati Bengals. He had bet that the Rams would win, and he was right in the end. He wagered nearly $400,000 for that game, and won back over a million. He posted all of it on his social media, which had some critics concerned due to the wagers being in Bitcoin.</p><p>More recently, Drake bet on the 2023 AFC Championship game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Cincinnati Bengals. He bet the Chiefs to win, and once again he was correct.</p><h2 id=here-39-s-how-gambling-has-actually-made-drake-a-lot-of-money>Here's How Gambling Has Actually Made Drake A Lot Of Money</h2><p>Drake does win a lot of his bets, but boy does he also lose a lot of them as well. With that being said, Drake's net worth might not actually be decimated by his new love of betting. That's despite all of his major gambling losses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Drake-And-His-Son-Adonis.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His bigger losses appear to be early season parlays, where bettors pick a series of teams early on to win it all in the end. For the 2021-2022 NBA season, Drake picked the Nets and the Mavericks to win the championship. This particular parlay also involved MLB bets, including Drake's bid that his hometown Toronto Blue Jays would win the World Series. Drake whiffed big on this parlay, and it was one of his biggest betting misses.</p><p>His most recent betting loss was one that was on full display. He publicly bet on the 2022 FIFA World Cup, believing that Argentina would win the whole thing. That loss was huge, losing Drake a mere $1.6 million, according to Mirror.uk.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dj-Khaled-and-Drake-(1).jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Casino.org, Drake has totaled a staggering $29.61 million in bet losses. That might seem like a lot, but overall, Drake has actually made a lot of money from gambling. His winning bets have made him over $70 million, which equates to a profit of $46 million. These are from Drake's publicly known bets, however, most of which have been publicized by Drake himself. Perhaps some of Drake's bigger losses have been kept closer to the chest.</p><p>Regardless, Drake does know a thing or two about sports. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drake recently helped Lebron James celebrate</a> his historic scoring record, and has shown to have a knack for sports betting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibq5mbmnqvsdNmrqiqpJ16tLzOq6usZZKawbW1zaBkpaejqLK0ecCnm2avmaPAcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kevin-costner-wins-big-in-child-support-case-as-ex-wife-gets-a-fraction-of-what-she-asked-for.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kevin Costner Wins Big In Child Support Case As Ex-Wife Gets A Fraction Of What She Asked For">&larr;
