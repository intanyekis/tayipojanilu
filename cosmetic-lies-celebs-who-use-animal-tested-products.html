Most of these companies state that they are against animal cruelty and do not test on animals in the United States, but are still performing experiments on animals in other countries. In the United States, it is not illegal to test on animals and according to the Food and Drug Administration, it is not necessary. In 2010, the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) launched a campaign to end all animal testing, and now all of Europe has banned it permanently. Unfortunately, there are still countries out there who believe that animal testing is still necessary in the realm of cosmetics. There are many celebrities that use or endorse these cosmetics and it is possible that they may not even know that the company that they are endorsing condone this.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=reese-witherspoon-s-rosy-cheeks>Reese Witherspoon’s Rosy Cheeks</h2><p>On their website, Avon claims that they care about and respect animals. In the late 1980’s, Avon Products, Inc. also stated that they were not going to do animal testing and still stand by that claim. Although, in other countries where testing is required by law, Avon must abide by those laws if they want to continue selling in that country. In 2012, Avon was forced to remove the fact that they did not test on animals in their brochures and on their website, for the simple fact that they do still sell and manufacture products in other places that require animal testing on cosmetics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are many celebrity faces associated with Avon; including <a title="Ashley Greene Net Worth" href=#>Ashley Greene</a>, <a title="Fergie Net Worth" href=#>Fergie</a> and <a title="Patrick Dempsey Net Worth" href=#>Patrick Dempsey</a>. According to Fashion Daily, academy award winner and producer, <a title="Reese Witherspoon Net Worth" href=#>Reese Witherspoon</a> became the “first ever Avon Global Ambassador” in 2007. She supports the stand against violence on women and children, and has does many charitable events related to such. According to an interview with Cosmopolitan, Witherspoon is not only the ambassador for Avon, but she is also a customer. Her favorite product is Avon Be Blushed Cheek Color. She states, “It's great to have something in your purse that functions as a blush and a lipstick."&nbsp;In 2006, Reese Witherspoon was named “sexiest vegetarian of the year” by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). Reese Witherspoon also starred in <i>Legally Blonde 2</i>, which ironically, is a film about a lawyer who tries to save her dog’s mother (among other animals) from cosmetic animal testing. We wonder, would Reese be okay with knowing Avon still uses animal testing in other places of the world?</p><p></p><h2 id=carmen-electra-goes-naked>Carmen Electra Goes Naked</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Procter and Gamble (P & G) is well known for making shampoo, perfumes, soaps and many different household products. What many people don’t know is that they also create some cosmetics, as well. These cosmetics lines include: Covergirl and Max Factor. On their website, P & G states that they are against animal cruelty and are claiming to end the use of animal testing, but are still doing so in 1% of the cases that have “no alternatives available.” Even though it is still a small percentage, it is still going on in the company. The company is currently working with the 'Humane Society of the United States' and the 'American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals' to try to end animal testing and to try to create better ways for research.</p><p><a title="Carmen Electra Net Worth" href=#>Carmen Electra</a> is a spokeswoman for Max Factor. Being a former television star and appearing in several movies like <i>Scary Movie</i>, there is no question, she wants to look good. Electra regularly works out and even appeared on the show,&nbsp;<i>Bethenny</i> in October 2013, sans makeup. Although, she says that she “feels naked without it,” proves that women do not need to wear a lot of cosmetics to show off their natural beauty.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=just-where-does-gwyneth-paltrow-stand>Just Where Does Gwyneth Paltrow Stand?</h2><p>It is no surprise to most people that <a title="Gwyneth Paltrow Net Worth" href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow</a> claims to be a vegetarian and animal-rights activist. The London resident and her children set up a lemonade stand trying to raise money to help out their charity, 'Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals'. The charity was basically England’s version of the Humane Society in the United States, back in July 2011. Yet, in 2008, she had posed for Vanity Fair wearing fur, but stated that she did not “realize it was real fur.” She also stated that she has turkey in her household every Thanksgiving. Sure, we all make mistakes,&nbsp;but how does she explain wearing makeup that is owned by a company that tests on animals?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Cosmopolitan, the beauty product that Gwyneth Paltrow cannot live without is Estee Lauder Signature, Hydra Bright Lustre Lipsticks. Paltrow says, “The elegant gold case is ultrafeminine and the shades are perfect.” Estee Lauder is against animal cruelty, but still continues to sell and create their products in other countries that require animal testing. Gwyneth is not alone in her choice of makeup, though. Other celebrities who use (or at least endorse) Estee Lauder are <a title="Elizabeth Hurley Net Worth" href=#>Elizabeth Hurley</a> and <a title="Vanessa Minnillo Net Worth" href=#>Vanessa Minillo</a>. Estee Lauder also owns several other companies, including MAC and Clinique, which are used by customers all over the world.</p><p></p><h2 id=revlon-has-no-plans-to-end-animal-testing>Revlon Has No Plans to End Animal Testing</h2><p><a title="Emma Stone Net Worth" href=#>Emma Stone</a> has her favorite Revlon cosmetics listed on the company’s website, but is she aware that Revlon allows its products to be tested on animals in China? Other celebrities such as <a title="Halle Berry Net Worth" href=#>Halle Berry</a>, <a title="Jessica Biel Net Worth" href=#>Jessica Biel</a> and <a title="Elle Macpherson Net Worth" href=#>Elle Macpherson</a> are all considered ambassadors for Revlon and have done several commercials for the cosmetic giant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although it does not state that they do animal testing, Revlon does not post on their website that they do not. Revlon also has a map that lists their locations, with China being one of them. China is one of the countries of the world that requires animal testing on cosmetics, so one would assume that animal testing is being done, at least in that area. In an article from PETA (People for Ethical Treatment of Animals) dated June 7, 2013, a representative for the company was attending a meeting with Revlon and its executives.&nbsp; During that time, the representative (from PETA) asked a question regarding the sale of Revlon cosmetics in China and was told that “Revlon sells its products in countries that require tests on animals for its products - and has no plans to stop.”</p><p></p><h2 id=michelle-kwan-olympic-medalist>Michelle Kwan Olympic Medalist</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Five-time world ice skating champion, <a title="Michelle Kwan Net Worth" href=#>Michelle Kwan</a> describes her favorite makeup as “Shiseido Foundation in shade O60. It's the only foundation that I can sweat through without irritating my skin,” according to Cosmopolitan Magazine. It’s fortunate that some can find a makeup that can do that, but at what price? Shiseido is another cosmetic company that is against animal cruelty, but they have a market for their product in China.&nbsp; According to Shiseido’s Cross-Channel Brand Growth Strategy in 2007, “Shiseido’s China business sustained rapid year-on-year growth in sales that surpassed 30%, and this business has served as an engine of growth for the entire Shiseido Group.” This means that Shiseido Cosmetics were being sold in China, which actually has laws demanding that makeup is to be tested on animals.</p><p>A company cannot accurately say that they are against the testing of cosmetics on animals, especially if they allow it to happen in another country for sales or manufacturing of their product. PETA is trying its best to change laws regarding animal cruelty and the testing that is being done on them. Several people are using these cosmetics every day unknowingly and some companies are just not going to budge when it comes to selling their product. No matter what.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmacp6OisrW1wmajop2jYrCmuMSbqmavmKR6tr%2FEZpinoZ2WuW7AxKyrnpxdpb%2BwsNScq6xn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./did-colonel-tom-parker-steal-from-elvis-presley-new-biopic-details-parkers-bad-side.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Colonel Tom Parker Steal From Elvis Presley?
