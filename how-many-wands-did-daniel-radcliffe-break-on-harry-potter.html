Pierre noted, "We've probably produced over 70, 80 of those.

Radcliffe then looked shocked, eyes wide, and said, "I thought you said eight!"</p><p>Processing the information, Daniel said, "Wooooow... I'm so sorry Pierre."</p><p>As Daniel processed the information, the video runs a sequence of videos of him with Harry's wand: poking it against the ground, tapping it against his palm, drumming against his leg.</p><p>While the video ran, Daniel could be heard admitting, "I don't know how I've managed to break that many wands. I know I drum with my wands a lot, I bang them against my leg and sort of do some rhythm. I really don't know, I just feel very bad..."</p><p>When asked whether he hadn't just been sneaking the props off the set, Radcliffe responded, "I really haven't been, I'm not the person selling them on eBay."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Later, however, once he processed the information, Daniel had a very different explanation for the statistic about how many wands he broke.</p><h2 id=daniel-radcliffe-swears-he-didn-39-t-break-that-many-wands-during-harry-potter>Daniel Radcliffe Swears He Didn't Break That Many Wands During Harry Potter</h2><p>Fast forward a decade or so, and Daniel Radcliffe now swears he never broke 70-80 wands while on the set of Harry Potter. In WIRED's Autocomplete Interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel answered the question of how many Harry Potter wands he actually broke</a> during filming.</p><p>The most-searched question was "How many times did Daniel Radcliffe break his wand," to which Daniel replied that it was a rumor he would "like to disperse." Daniel noted that he sometimes sees the "amazing fact" that he broke a hundred wands or "like 60 wands" on set.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/emma-watson-s-relationship-with-daniel-radcliffe-had-its-ups-but-also-quite-a-bit-of-downs.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Daniel Radcliffe And Emma Watson Absolutely Hated Filming This Iconic Scene In Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows">Daniel Radcliffe And Emma Watson Absolutely Hated Filming This Iconic Scene In Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Despite the enormous perks, taking part in the Harry Potter franchise was not exactly a walk in the park for Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe.</p><p>To that, Daniel said, "It's not that many, guys." He reiterated the story of drumming with his wand, which he agreed would break the prop down over time. However, Radcliffe maintains that everyone on set eventually broke some wands, but "it wasn't as many as that and I feel like everyone got through a few and I was probably 12 maximum—absolute maximum— of 20."</p><h2 id=daniel-also-says-he-didn-39-t-break-as-many-pairs-of-harry-39-s-glasses-as-rumored-either>Daniel Also Says He Didn't Break As Many Pairs Of Harry's Glasses As Rumored, Either</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/harry-potter-cast.jpg><p>Daniel has addressed the wand-breaking rumors multiple times already, in various interviews. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel discussed his Harry Potter prop problems during an appearance on Hot Ones</a>, explaining that he did break some wands.</p><p>In that interview, Radcliffe also gave a more specific count of how many wands he snapped, noting, "So, once every three or four weeks, it would weaken to the point where it just snapped.
