She has appeared in some American television shows, beginning with her regular role as Snow White’s Stepmother, Evil Queen Lillian “Lily” White in the series The Charmings.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=1998-2008></span><span>1998-2008</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Parfitt’s real-life husband Tony Steedman guest-starred as Santa Claus in The Charmings’ second season Christmas special.
