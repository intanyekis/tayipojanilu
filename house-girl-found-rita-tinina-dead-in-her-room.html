Luckily, Tinina had not locked the door from inside.</p><p>The house girl called her but there was no response. By then, Tinina’s nine year old girl was watching television in the living room.</p><p>The house girl said she touched Tinina and realized she was unresponsive.</p><p>She realized she was dead.
