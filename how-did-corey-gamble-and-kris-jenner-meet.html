Initially criticized for their 25-year age gap, the couple has proven in the last years that age doesn't matter. However, <a href=#>fans still accuse Gamble of dating Jenner only for her money</a>. Little do they know, <a href=#>he's actually a big-shot music executive</a>. Here's everything you should know about him and his relationship with the momager.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kris Jenner Hopes Her Next Grandchild Comes From This Sister</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-corey-gamble-and-what-does-he-do>Who Is Corey Gamble And What Does He Do?</h2><p>Before being known as Jenner's boyfriend, Gamble has already established himself as a business executive and talent manager. He's currently working for SB Projects, a company owned by Scooter Braun. As a result, Gamble has also worked as Justin Bieber's tour manager. They're pretty close as well. He refers to the Yummy singer as his "nephew." Gamble is originally from Atlanta, Georgia. There, he finished his degree in business marketing before moving to L.A. where he now lives with Jenner.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 41-year-old is said to be worth $15 million. But given <a href=#>Jenner's net worth of $190 million</a>, which she's amassed from <a href=#>her 10% cut from all of her daughter's business ventures</a>, we get why some would think Gamble is only in it for the money. Fans were especially worried after <a href=#>rumors that he had cheated on the momager</a>. Even <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a> weighed in on the matter.</p><p>"God has a plan to take out the godless Corey he needed to never be here anyway," claimed the rapper after the news broke out. "When Kris got divorced, he slipped into He became the TV version of a father figure... We still haven't met his family and I guess we never will. He connected my wife to the liberals in a deep way which was his job. For some reason I always felt like that he worked for DuPont or some organization of that pedigree."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Justin Bieber Really Date Kendall Jenner?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-did-corey-gamble-amp-kris-jenner-start-dating>When Did Corey Gamble & Kris Jenner Start Dating?</h2><p>The pair first met in Ibiza in 2014. It was at fashion designer Riccardo Tisci's 40th birthday party. The party was thrown by West who's also represented by Braun. At the time, Jenner was going through her divorce. Gamble's last relationship was with Atlanta Exes star Sheree Buchanan. They were together for three years. It's unclear whether romance instantly sparked between the two following their first meeting. However, in October that year, Gamble was spotted with the Kardashian-Jenners during their family trip for <strong><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a></strong>'s 40th birthday.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple made it Instagram official in 2015 when Jenner posted a photo of them on a double date with <a href=#>Tish and Billy Ray Cyrus</a>. They were rumored to have broken up around 2017, but in August 2018, fans thought they were actually engaged. Jenner was seen wearing a huge diamond ring during her appearance on The Late Late Show. Since then, neither of them has confirmed the speculations.</p><p>Jenner previously told <strong><a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres</a></strong> that she wasn't keen on marrying again. "You know, I've done that twice and it didn't work out so well," she said on The Ellen Show in 2017. "So I don't know you never know. I'm going to take a page out of [Goldie Hawn] and [Kurt Russell]'s book. Or <strong><a href=#>Kourtney [Kardashian]</a></strong>'s book. I think as long as things are going so well, why ruffle it up?" But hey, <a href=#>her daughter is now engaged to Travis Barker</a> and <a href=#>soon, we'll see her walking down the aisle too</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Well Is Kendall Jenner's Tequila 818 Brand Doing?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-corey-gamble-get-along-well-with-the-kardashian-jenners>Does Corey Gamble Get Along Well With The Kardashian-Jenners?</h2><p>In May 2019, Ye's concerns about not meeting Gamble's family caught up with the Kardashian-Jenners. "We tried to get to know him, but he has not been receptive in this whole thing," said <strong><a href=#>Khloe Kardashian</a></strong>. It got worse when Gamble sided with <strong><a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a></strong> during a fight with her sister Kendall. The latter said that Gamble had told her to "f---off."</p><p>The 818 Tequila founder confronted the talent manager to which he replied: "You've been a rude person for years. You're an a--hole when you feel like it, you get riled up for no reason. I'm about to tell you the truth about how you are. You don't apologise for nothing." Its unclear whether the two have made up since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At one point, Gamble also got in a heated conversation with <a href=#>Kourtney and her ex-husband Scott Disick</a>. It was over their daughter Penelope who had allegedly scratched her nanny. "If P scratch me, I'm whipping her ass," Gamble reacted. "Give her a spanking for sure." His comments have seriously offended the ex-couple. "He [Corey] will never be with my kids alone and if he does that in front of any of us there will be a f--king issue!" said Kourtney.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kanye West Posts A New Rant About Kim Kardashian And Their Daughter North</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbalecKoqZ6xXZyurq7LnmSappRiuLO10mahnqaemr9uucSeq2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lin-manuel-miranda-walk-of-fame-521296.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lin-Manuel Earns A Star On The Hollywood Walk Of Fame">&larr;
