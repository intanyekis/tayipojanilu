Today, Nicky is known as a businesswoman, socialite, model, and fashion designer. However, while Paris Hilton seems to thrive in the spotlight, <a href=#>Nicky Hilton tends to prefer staying out of the limelight</a>. She has been married to financier James Rothschild since 2015 and together they have two daughters — Lily Grace Victoria Rothschild born in 2016 and Theodora "Teddy" Marilyn Rothschild born in 2017.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-parents-kathy-and-richard-hilton-have-a-combined-net-worth-of-350-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Her Parents Kathy And Richard Hilton Have A Combined Net Worth Of $350 Million</span></h2><p>Of course, this list would not be complete without Paris Hilton's parents — Kathy and Richard Hilton.

Besides this, Kim Richards has also appeared in multiple seasons of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Currently, Kim <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">is estimated to have a net worth of $400,000</a> which means that she is certainly not as rich as the rest of the family.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Fans Are Still Upset With David Letterman Over This Paris Hilton Interview</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinmqqZqHqptcutpqdlk5a%2FtbHRZqmerZ1iuKLAx7JkoaGcqbyvecWapKKkqWK7psCMsKarrJhk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./karl-jacobs-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Karl Jacobs Net Worth  How Much Is Karl Jacobs Worth?">&larr;
