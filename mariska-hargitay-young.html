As the longest-running primetime live-action series, the actress has earned a devoted following of fans who have followed her every step of the way.</p><p>Mariska Hargitay was born on January 23, 1964, in Santa Monica, California, into a famous family. Hargitay is the daughter of American actress and Playboy playmate <a href=#>Jayne Mansfield</a> and actor and body builder Mickey Hargitay. Her mother, a 1950s Hollywood icon, appeared in several hits on Broadway and at the box office. Jayne was tragically killed in a car crash in 1967; Mariska (who was only three years old) and her brothers, Zoltan Hargitay and Mickey Hargitay Jr., were in the car at the time but miraculously survived the fatal accident. Hargitay attended UCLA School of Theater Film and Television but left before completing her degree. She later went to Groundlings Theatre and School in Los Angeles.</p><p>Hargitay enrolled in pageant competitions and was crowned Miss Beverly Hills USA in 1982. She later competed in Miss California USA and appeared in a few music videos before landing minor roles in TV and films like Ghoulies, Baywatch, Leaving Las Vegas, Tequila and Bonetti, Seinfeld, ER and more. Her first major TV roles came from the 1986 crime series Downtown and the nighttime soap opera Falcon Crest.</p><p>Hargitay is currently <a href=#>married to Peter Hermann</a>, a fellow actor who is best known for his roles in&nbsp;Younger,&nbsp;Law & Order: SVU&nbsp;and&nbsp;Blue Bloods. (He also was in the soap opera&nbsp;Guiding Light,&nbsp;where he played Dr. Michael Burke, who infamously was responsible for the cloning of Reva Shayne.) Hargitay met her future husband on the set of&nbsp;Law & Order: SVU&nbsp;in Season 3 when Hermann guest-starred as defense attorney Trevor Langan. They dated for two years before tying the knot in Santa Barbara, California, in 2004. Two years later, Mariska and Peter welcomed their first child, son August Miklos Hermann, on June 28, 2006. They adopted their next two children, daughter Amaya Josephine Hermann and son Andrew Nicolas Hargitay Hermann, in 2011.</p><p>Read on to see what <a href=#>Mariska Hargitay looked like when she was young</a> and photos of the actress through the years.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>1986: Mariska Hargitay Stars in Downtown</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Mariska-Hargitay-Young.jpg><p>Before tracking down criminals on SVU, Hargitay starred in the CBS crime drama Downtown as Jesse Smith.

I had never been so excited about it,” Hargitay told <a href=#>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</a>&nbsp;in May 2019. “And the thing that was interesting is that my agent called me, and he said, ‘Maris, you know it’s very dark subject matter. I don’t know if it’s your thing. I don’t know if it’s going to be your bag, it’s super dark.’ I read it and just, you know, chills.
