Fans of varying age groups and from all parts of the globe have come to know and love the famous comedian and talk show host, and he's quite easily pegged as being<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> one of the hardest working men in the entertainment industry</a>. Harvey's success is matched only by his fortune,&nbsp;and he&nbsp;has now reached an astounding $200 million net worth. He's living in the lap of luxury these days, and can easily live off his current earnings for the rest of his life. However, things weren't always easy for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the once-homeless star.</a> He comes from a life of struggle, and that has had a huge impact on the man he is today. His <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">real life rags-to-riches story </a>will amaze you...</p><h2 id=harvey-was-homeless>Harvey Was Homeless</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Steve Harvey has managed to go from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">being homeless to becoming a multi-millionaire,</a> and has worked incredibly hard to get to this stage in his life. He was born into a modest family in West Virginia. His father was a coal miner, and worked hard to provide for his family. The Harveys moved to Cleveland, and that is where Steve Harvey completed high school.</p><p>In his younger days, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve Harvey did whatever he could to make ends meet</a>. He worked as a mechanic, an insurance salesman, mail carrier, and carpet cleaner, and wasn't afraid to take on any job that would put money in his pocket. At one point, he took on a boxing career and earned cash in the ring.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unable to find a solid career path for himself, the unreliable jobs weren't enough to sustain him, and Harvey found himself living in his car. It was 1980, and he owned a 1976 Ford Tempo that soon became his home. Proving his resilience and sheer determination to better his life, Harvey continued to take on any job that came his way. He kept a cooler in the back of his car, which he filled with whatever food items he was able to locate, and showered at swimming pools and gas stations to keep himself healthy.&nbsp; Understandably, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he called this phase of his life "rock bottom,"</a> and sadly, it took him 3 full years to get past that stage of his life. During this time, he was exploring jobs as a comedian, and some shows would put him up in a hotel as part of their arrangements. Those were few and far between, but were very welcome opportunities for him to rest in a safer space.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meet Lisa Barlow, The Self-Made Millionaire From 'The Real Housewives Of Salt Lake City'</a></span></p><h2 id=faith-and-tenacity-kept-him-moving-forward>Faith And Tenacity Kept Him Moving Forward</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Steve Harvey's future was looking bleak, and the prospect of success seemed to be a long shot, but he didn't ever stop trying. He took on any job he managed to secure, and tried to keep his state of mind healthy during <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his toughest times</a>. Recalling the days of homelessness, he says; "That was an ugly period, just very painful. Everybody has a moment when they turn back, when you say to yourself, This is too much.&nbsp;I had it on several occasions.”</p><p>Through <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his most difficult times</a>, Steve Harvey <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">relied heavily on his faith</a> to survive. He truly felt that if he kept positive and continued to try to move forward in any way he could, that he would gain traction. Harvey&nbsp;described one of his most painful moments, saying; "I sat down and started crying, but a voice said, ‘If you keep going, I’m going to take you places you’ve never been, It was like God said, ‘Don’t quit, you’re almost there.’ ”</p><p>Harvey continues to credit his success to his faith in God.</p><h2 id=steve-s-big-break>Steve's Big Break</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 1985, Steve Harvey took the stage to give his first<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> stand-up comedy show</a>. It didn't pay exceptionally&nbsp; well,&nbsp;at times he only brought home $50 a day - but it paid&nbsp; - and he enjoyed it. It was hard to find<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> stability as a comedian,</a> but in no time at all, he landed a spot as the host of the television show It's Showtime at the Apollo, and then he secured a high profile spot on Cedric the Entertainer and Bernie Mac's Kings Of Comedy tour.</p><p>Steve Harvey's star continued to rise, and his name is now attached to a variety of successful, prominent television shows. His most notable appearances include his rein as the host of the hit family game show Family Feud, Celebrity Family Feud, and The Steve Harvey Show. He has also hosted Little Big Shots, and has been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the long time host of the Miss Universe pageant. </a>His hard work and tenacity have most certainly paid off. Steve Harvey is absolutely everywhere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He has expanded his income stream by taking on<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> a series of shows and projects</a>. He has even penned a book, Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man, which has been developed as a movie. His book sat on the New York Times Best Sellers List for a jaw-dropping 64 straight weeks.</p><p>He was right about his perspective... when he puts his mind to it, Steve Harvey really can do anything.</p><h2 id=amassing-a-200-million-fortune>Amassing A $200 Million Fortune</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvey's journey through various aspects of the entertainment industry </a>has led him straight to an astronomical<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> $200 million net worth</a>. He has now officially reached a whole new level of fame and fortune - and he can easily live off the money he has already earned for the rest of his life, without making any sort of lifestyle sacrifices.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As one of the most recognizable names and faces in the entertainment industry, Steve Harvey commands top wage for any project he takes on. He has a massive fan following that supports every project he takes on, and that carries a lot of influence and power, which any television network and big brand would find to be incredibly attractive.</p><p>Harvey currently snags $10 million a season as the host of Family Feud, and another $20 million a year from his radio hosting role. Easily considered to be one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hardest working men</a> in the world of entertainment, he also launched his own dating site called Delightful, and has gone on to publish more books, titled Straight Talk, No Chaser, Act Like A Success, and Jump: Take the Leap of Faith to Achieve Your Life of Abundance.</p><p>Commenting on his astounding financial success, in contrast to the crushing poverty he once faced, Harvey has said;&nbsp;“It kills me when I hear very successful people say, ‘I always knew I would get here, I didn’t. I always hoped I would get somewhere, but this is above and beyond. My imagination didn’t even go this big.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His life is now one of abundance. He indulges on anything his heart desires, and splurges on his brand name label attire, his love for expensive cigars, and of course, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he lives in a $15 million mansion with his family.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Truly humble to the core, Harvey still maintains <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a modest outlook on his incredible fortune. </a>“I’m running from homelessness.&nbsp;I can’t ever be in that position again. If my show gets canceled, I’ve got three more. I don’t have any free time, but I have 12 jobs.”</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Plastic Surgeon Of The Stars: Inside The Massive Fortune Of Dr. Terry Dubrow</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheatsheet</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">KoiMoi</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1sMOMrKuerpVitaK%2B1Z6wrGWkmruir8itsGaklZl6qbXMZp2rp51itbC5xKWcrKuemsC0edOoZJplYmV9brnIpaOip55is7C%2B066lnmc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jacob-kasper.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="jacob kasper - Wrestlezone">&larr;
