The split has been an adjustment for Jack Edward, as well as the other children the two share: Vivian Lake and Benjamin Rein. It seems as though every family member is trying to figure out what life looks like now. It remains to be seen if <a href=#>Gisele will be able to continue having a relationship with her former step-son</a>. The two were very close, and their relationship certainly made the divorce more complicated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tom and Gisele have begun to move on from each other. Tom is rumored to be seeing <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> following several sightings of them together. Gisele, for her part, is rumored to be dating Jeffrey Soffer, who is a developer.
