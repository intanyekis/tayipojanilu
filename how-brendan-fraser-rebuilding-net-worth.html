Years ago, just as he concluded his popular The Mummy trilogy, Fraser endured a painful divorce, watched his mother pass away, and his career suffered after Hollywood blacklisted him for reasons that are both disgusting and tragic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Brendan Fraser’s Next Movie Will Either Make Or Destroy His Career</a></span></p><p>The Mummy franchise is one of the most successful to come out of Hollywood in the early 2000s, raking in over $1,000,000,000 at the box office. The film once earned Fraser <a href=#>a $45 million net worth</a>, which quickly depleted once his career slowed down, although he is still worth <a href=#>a cool $20 million</a> today. However, that number will be going up very soon.</p><h2 id=brendan-fraser-lost-his-money-due-to-alimony-payments><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Brendan Fraser Lost His Money Due To Alimony Payments</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Fraser’s career was beginning to struggle, his personal life also became complicated. Brendan Fraser and his wife Afton Smith started <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a painful divorce process in 2007</a>. Fraser was ordered to pay Smith $50,000 a month in alimony and $25,000 a month in child support payments. In total, Fraser had to pay his wife $900,000 a year until his children were grown and until Smith remarried. One would think that with $45 million, Fraser could handle this, but Fraser needed the money because it was around this same time he started to lose work – but why? Why was this box-office magnet of an actor all of a sudden struggling in Hollywood?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Brendan Fraser Had A Scary Accident While Filming ‘The Mummy’</a></span></p><h2 id=his-career-slowed-down-because-he-came-forward-with-allegations-against-phillip-berk><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>His Career Slowed Down Because He Came Forward With Allegations Against Phillip Berk</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Phillip Berk used to be one of the most powerful men in Hollywood. The former journalist was the head of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, one of the leading film associations second only to the Academy. In 2018, thanks to support from the MeToo movement, Fraser came forward with allegations <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">that Berk had sexually assaulted him in 2003</a>, and that when he tried coming forward at first that Berk had Fraser blacklisted, forcing Fraser to do flop movies in his desperate attempt to make his alimony payments. Berk has since stepped down from the HFPA, and he was expelled permanently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when a racist email he wrote was leaked</a>.</p><h2 id=brendan-fraser-had-to-get-multiple-surgeries><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Brendan Fraser Had To Get Multiple Surgeries</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to divorce, assault, and black listing, one of Fraser's career choices finally caught up with him, which in turn forced him to slow down his career. Fraser, famously, used to do his own stunts, but by 2013, the actor needed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple surgeries</a> due to injuries he had sustained over the years. Losing his agility, something that once made his career, along with all the other trauma he endured, drove Fraser into a depression that he only recently dug himself out of.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Tragic Truth About Brendan Fraser's Health Issues</a></span></p><h2 id=he-started-his-comeback-with-39-the-affair-39-and-39-trust-39><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Started His Comeback with 'The Affair' And 'Trust'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fraser found work here and there in the 2010s, but nothing like the box-office smashes that he used to ride high on. But, things began to turn around in 2016, when he landed a supporting role on the popular TV drama The Affair. He also found himself starring in Trust, a series depicting the drama of the prominent Getty family. Fans began to notice their favorite actor was reemerging, and soon after this reemergence, Fraser came forward about his allegations against Berk. Fans were incredibly supportive and continue to voice their support all over social media.</p><h2 id=brendan-fraser-joined-the-dc-extended-universe><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Brendan Fraser Joined The DC Extended Universe</span></h2><p>With the public behind him once again, Fraser soon found his way back on the set. He joined the DC Extended Universe when he played Robotman on Titans, a role he reprised in the spin-off series Doom Patrol. In the upcoming DC film Batgirl, Fraser is signed on to play the villain Firefly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brendan-fraser-will-star-in-films-directed-by-oscar-winners-like-martin-scorcesse><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Brendan Fraser Will Star In Films Directed By Oscar Winners Like Martin Scorcesse</span></h2><p>Once blacklisted thanks to a Hollywood mogul, now Brendan Fraser is a magnet for them. Darren Aronofsky, who brought the world Requiem For A Dream, Black Swan, and The Wrestler (which was a comeback vehicle for another actor, Mickey Rooney), has cast Fraser in his new film The Whale. He will also be in Martin Scorsese's next project, Killers of The Flower Moon.</p><h2 id=his-comeback-has-been-dubbed-quot-the-brennasiance-quot><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>His Comeback Has Been Dubbed "The Brennasiance"</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans are so excited to see the actor return to A-list status that his comeback has been dubbed, “The Brenaissance.” Brendan Fraser's return marks a significant shift in Hollywood. No longer can power players like Phillip Berk abuse good people like Fraser and get away with it. One reason fans like Fraser so much is they can see themselves in him. Fraser did everything right, he worked hard, but thanks to things out of his control he struggled for years. There are a lot of people who can relate to that. Fraser isn’t just an actor, he is an actor with one of the most relatable falls from grace working in Hollywood. From that fall, Fraser rises once again, and fans are right, the Brennasiance is here.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:<a href=#> What Is Brendan Fraser's Ex Wife Afton Smith Doing Now?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dl7%2BmusOapWaeopbApr6Mq5ybrZmhsaq6xmalnqxdrLyzwMdo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./maggie-baugh-net-worth-2021-age-wikipedia-biography-height-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Maggie Baugh  Net Worth, Age, Wikipedia, Biography, Height, Family">&larr;
