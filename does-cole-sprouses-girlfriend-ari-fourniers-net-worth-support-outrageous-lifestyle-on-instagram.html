According to sources like Gossip Gist and Popular Net Worth, she has $500,000. Other websites say she has $600,000 and others say between $2 million and $3 million.</p><p>None of these numbers are verified or confirmed. However, fans can guess that she has at least a few hundred thousand dollars because she has been modeling for a long time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ari-fournier.jpg><p>It's rare to be able to make a living doing something fun, and Cole Sprouse's girlfriend seems to really like the way that she makes money.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ari Fournier talked about modeling</a> with CFDA and explained why she loves the business. She said, 'Iâ€™ve always had a passion for the self-expression that comes with fashion. My mom used to model in the 80s and kept a really elaborate closet with her favorite archival pieces."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Cole Sprouse Is Really Like To Date According To His Current And Ex-Girlfriends</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued, "I used to play dress up with her when I was a child, trying on her most experimental pieces and thinking, 'one day I will grow up and I will be able to dress up like her!' I get to take that same inner child to work with me, so I feel very grateful for what I do."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/cole-sprouse-admitted-that-his-time-away-from-hollywood-helped-keep-him-grounded.jpg><p>According to Fashion Republic Magazine, Fournier has been a part of the modeling industry since she was 15.

She never seems to stay in one place for long and loves wearing beautiful clothing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of her most recent Instagram posts share a summer 2023 vacation to Croatia and an appearance at Cole Sprouse's brother Dylan Sprouse's wedding to Barbara Palvin. As she wrote in the caption of the wedding, "Most special time in Hungary celebrating Dylan and Barbara. It was such a privilege having quality time with everyone and learning the Hungarian wedding traditions."</p><p>Fournier posted a photo of an outdoor lunch spot in Croatia and tagged Adriatic Luxury Hotels, which is where she was staying.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ari-fournier-1.jpg><p>According to the hotel's website, people can book "luxury villas" at this property. It's definitely not cheap to stay here. For example, if someone books a stay at the Villa Agave, they will get a three-bedroom house that is huge and fancy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>None of these hotels will be cheap. According to Travel Weekly, the Villa Orsula costs $795 a night. The Hotel Excelsior costs $517 per night and the Hotel Bellevue is $467.</p><p>Considering the fact that Ari Fournier likely stayed for at least a week, these rates would add up quickly.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Do Cole And Dylan Sprouse Actually Hate Acting?

She works a lot and must bring home a regular paycheck. While she doesn't appear to have tens of millions of dollars in the bank, many sources say that she has half a million. That seems to be enough to pay for regular travel and nice clothing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ari-fournier-2.jpg><p>It's also worth noting that some of what Ari Fournier posts on her Instagram account is work-related. She attends a lot of industry events and she wouldn't have to pay for those herself.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Cole Sprouse Is Really Like To Work With, According To Lana Condor, Lili Reinhart, And His Various Co-Stars</a></span></p><p>Ari Fournier and Cole Sprouse also travel together. In the summer of 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the couple went to Greece</a>. As The Daily Mail reported, she posted about it on Instagram, and it looked amazing. While of course there's no way of knowing what this vacation cost unless the stars say so themselves, it looked like an incredible trip that was full of luxuries.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/cole-sprouse-and-lili-reinhart.jpg><p>Ari Fournier and Cole Sprouse look like an extremely happy couple. They seem to be a great fit for one another because they don't talk to the media a lot about their relationship. After Sprouse's dramatic relationship with Lili Reinhart, that seems to be exactly what he wants.</p><p>Fournier posted about their relationship once and said that they have a great time. Besides that, though, she hasn't said very much about Sprouse besides wishing him a happy 30th birthday on Instagram. Sprouse, however, has mentioned that his fans don't seem to like when he talks about her on social media or vice versa.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ari-fournier-3.jpg><p>According to E! News, Sprouse said to GQ Hype, "Followers report everything about Ari and me as bullying, and it gets taken down pretty immediately. Even on my other friends' accounts, it gets taken down."</p><p>Fashion Republic Magazine reported that Ari Fournier is a model with several agencies including Elite Model Management, The Industry LA Folio Montreal, and Premier Model Management. It seems likely that she will continue to be paid well as a model and this will allow her to do anything that she wants.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqJ2jYrCwuMRmqqmqn6rApr%2BMoKCrpJantqa6w2aYq6Fdm7y2vs2inKurXaOytXnWqKmtoF2owrG8zqurZqelqb%2Bis8SorKxlnJ6zpr%2FTsqOeZZ%2Bjeqq60q2YoKqRonw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./james-corden-bio-wife-children-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="James Corden Bio, Wiki, Wife, Children, Net worth, Height, Family">&larr;
