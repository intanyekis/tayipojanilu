However, there is someone who is living our fantasy and that is Rose Dorothy Dauriac, the singular child of the actress who she had in 2014 with her now-divorced husband, Romain Dauriac.</p><p>Here’s all there is to know about the child that might one day, grow up to rule Hollywood like her mother and what really went wrong with her parents.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Rose Dorothy Dauriac’s Biography</strong></h3><ul><li><b>Full name: </b>Rose Dorothy Dauriac</li><li><b>Gender: </b>Female</li><li><b>Date of birth: </b>August 30, 2014</li><li><b><strong>Rose Dorothy Dauriac’s</strong> Age: </b>9 Years Old</li><li><b>Ethnicity: </b>White</li><li><b>Nationality: </b>American</li><li><b>Zodiac Sign: </b>Virgo</li><li><b><strong>Rose Dorothy Dauriac’s</strong> Parents: </b>Romain Dauriac and Scarlett Johansson</li><li><b>Siblings: </b>Cosmo Jost</li><li><b>Famous for: </b>Being the daughter of Celebrity American Actress, Scarlett Johansson</li></ul><h2><strong>Who Is Rose Dorothy Dauriac?</strong></h2><p>The Kardashian-Jenner kids might be the dominating name for celebrity children in the news but one child who is quietly going about the business of enjoying life as the child of a superstar is Rose Dorothy. The adorable girl who was born on the 30th of August 2014 to a French journalist, Romain Dauriac and megastar actress, Scarlett Johansson. She’s of French, Danish, Polish and Swedish descent due to her parents’ origins.</p><p>In recent interviews given by her mother, Rose Dorothy Dauriac is said to have possessed a share of her mother’s intelligence and wittiness. While details of her education are currently not of public knowledge as a matter of privacy and security, she’s currently a pre-school student.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Scarlett-Johansson-1.jpg><p>There is every likelihood that Rose may grow up following in the footsteps of her mother, having been born in a family of actors and actresses. Her grandmother, Melanie Sloan is a film producer. While her maternal uncles and aunts; Adrian, Hunter and Vanessa Johansson are all active in Hollywood.</p><h2><b>Who Are Her Parents?</b></h2><p>Rose Dorothy Dauriac’s father, Romain Dauriac is a French journalist and art curator who serves as the owner of a creative advertising agency. He became prominently recognized after working as an editor of Clark, a French art magazine. He has had a thriving career in journalism and creative advertising as his financial value is estimated at $1.5 million.</p><p>Whereas, her mother, Scarlett Johansson is a movie star who has accumulated both fame and fortune concurrently, having been the highest-paid actress in the world since 2018. She is the third-highest grossing box office actor in history, with her movies grossing over $14 billion across the globe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Rose-Dorothy.jpeg><p>Johansson has starred in more than sixty movies and TV shows and in the process, has earned numerous accolades including Tony Awards, British Academy Film Awards, MTV Movie & TV Awards, etc. Her noteworthy roles can be seen in the Avengers film series, Captain America film series, Iron Man 2, He’s Just Not That Into You, to mention a few. The megastar actress sits on a jaw-dropping net worth of about $140 million as of 2019.</p><h2><strong>Scarlett Johansson’s Split With Romain Dauriac</strong></h2><p>Scarlett Johansson whose marriage to fellow actor, Ryan Reynolds was annulled in 2011, got entangled in the web of love again when she came in contact with journalist turned art curator, Romain Dauriac. According to the popular actress, she met her ex-husband through a friend in Paris. Soon after, the atmosphere became romantic and the pair began dating.</p><p>In November 2012, they made the relationship public and then went on to tie the knot in a secret wedding held at the Rock Creek’s Ranch in Philipsburg, Montana, United States in October 2014, after the birth of Rose Dorothy Dauriac. The couple maintained a happy and loving marital relationship until the summer of 2016 when the marriage hit rock bottom as Scarlett and Dauriac got locally separated.</p><p>Trying to talk things over as a couple and equally see if they can work out their differences, Rose Dorothy Dauriac’s father was surprised to find out that the movie star has already filed for a divorce in a New York City court in March 2017. Learning of the divorce filing, Dauriac implored Scarlett to withdraw her action for the sake of their loving daughter whom they will co-parent for many years, and to see if their negotiation would yield a positive result.</p><p>Having stated that their union was irretrievably broken, the award-winning actress pressed on with the divorce proceedings. However, after the shocking news of the marriage dissolution of Rose Dorothy Dauriac’s parents went public, so many factors were said to have contributed to the crashing of the union.</p><p>First, was that the couple went too fast with the relationship, having kicked an affair in late October 2012 and then got engaged ten months later. The second factor was reported to be that the two didn’t have much in common as Scarlett previously cited that their personal differences were what got them hooked up to each other. But perhaps, those differences were too great to be genuinely compatible.</p><p>Other factors that were reported to have led to Scarlett and Dauriac’s divorce include her busy schedule, language barrier, being that Romain Dauriac barely spoke English when they met, and the fact that the Avengers actress is not into monogamy.</p><p>Prior to the split, she revealed that although marriage is a beautiful idea and very romantic, it involves a lot of work and she doesn’t buy the idea that it’s natural for one to be monogamous. That being said, Scarlett Johansson has moved on with her life. She got engaged to Saturday Night Live star, Colin Jost in May 2019.</p><h2><strong>Rose Dorothy Dauriac’s Custody Battle</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Rose-Dorothy-2.jpg><p>Following Scarlett’s filing of divorce from her ex-husband, Romain Dauriac in March 2017, a messy custody battle ensued between the two. Meanwhile, the pair who initially got separated in September 2016 already had an informal co-parenting agreement in place before they started dragging for the custody of Rose Dorothy Dauriac in court.</p><p>The agreement, however, went up in flames after Scarlett Johansson requested a shorter schedule as a result of her career and other work-related engagements. This caused a rift between the two as Dauriac began to complain that his life was beginning to revolve around the schedule of the actress who seems to travel too much for filming.</p><p>In the divorce filing, Scarlett made a request to have joint custody of Rose Dorothy Dauriac but wants her daughter to live with her. This was opposed by her ex-husband who cited that Scarlett Johansson travels so much, and as a result of that, he pursued joint and physical custody of their daughter whom he wants to raise in France.</p><p>After a long battle in court, the former couple settled their custody dispute in Manhattan Supreme Court. They were granted joint custody of their daughter, with both reaching an agreement regarding her custody. Their marriage dissolution proceedings were finalized on 13th September 2017 and the terms of the divorce are reportedly sealed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunC%2BzqycZpyfp7y1tNhmm5qtop6upHnJqJ%2BapqOovK%2B%2FjJ2Yrp%2BYqbKzew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./milo-manheim.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Zombie Actor, Milo Manheim Dating?">&larr;
