For many cat lovers, it’s a place you can lay down, relax, and get in all the kitty snuggles you desire. One of the last things you’d like to find when you crawl into your cozy bed is a pile of cat poop. After all, it can put a damper on your evening, and your night’s sleep.</p><p>So, if your cat has been skipping over the litter box and using your bed to go number two instead, we are here to help. Finding out the root cause can be a process of elimination. Below we will go over the potential causes for this behavior and some tips on how to solve this stinky, messy problem.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/petkeen.com/data:image/gif;base64></p><h2><span id=The_7_Reasons_Why_Your_Cat_Poops_on_Your_Bed>The 7 Reasons Why Your Cat Poops on Your Bed</span></h2><h3 class=num-head><span id=1_Health_Issues><span class=dhn>1.</span> Health Issues</span></h3><p>Illness or even parasites can cause changes in a cat’s bathroom habits and could potentially lead your cat to begin pooping on the bed. While there are many other reasons for this behavior, the first step you should take is having your cat examined by your veterinarian to rule out any potential health issues that could be causing this unusual behavior. If your cat gets a clean bill of health, then you can begin looking into other potential reasons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/petkeen.com/data:image/gif;base64><ul><li><strong>What You Can Do</strong></li></ul><p>Because a sudden <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel=nofollow>change in bowel habits</a> can be the result of an underlying medical condition,&nbsp; you need to contact your veterinarian immediately so that you can have your cat properly examined and diagnosed to rule out any <a href=# data-wpel-link=exclude>disease</a>, illness, or <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel=nofollow>parasitic infection</a>.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=2_Your_Cat_Is_Under_Stress><span class=dhn>2.</span> Your Cat Is Under Stress</span></h3><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel=nofollow>Cats tend to stress very easily</a>, especially if there has been a change in their routine or environment. When cats are experiencing high levels of stress, their behavior and habits can change suddenly and may even cause you concern for their overall health. Pooping on the bed could be a result of stress or overall unhappiness with what’s going on in their lives.</p><p>If you have recently brought a new cat home, it is naturally going to be fearful and unsure until it’s able to establish a level of comfort in this brand-new environment. If you have recently moved homes, remodeled, added a new addition to the household, or even had guests in and out of the home, this can cause your cat to experience high loads of stress and insecurity.</p><p>If you notice any significant behavioral differences, you need to reach out to the veterinarian for an evaluation. If your cat has recently started pooping on your bed after a noticeable change in lifestyle or routine, this could very well be the reason for the behavior.</p><ul><li><strong>What You Can Do</strong></li></ul><p>Your cat may be stressed due to something that you would not even think to consider. It’s important to take a close look into your overall environment, think about any changes that have been made to your overall lifestyle or even ones that just affect your cat. Once you determine the root cause of the stress, you can begin to find ways to cope with the problem and help your kitty relax and feel more comfortable.</p><p>In extreme cases of stress, your veterinarian may recommend pheromone sprays, supplements, or even medication to <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>help calm their nerves</a> and get them through a more trying period.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=3_Placement_of_the_Litter_Box><span class=dhn>3.</span> Placement of the Litter Box</span></h3><p>Let’s face it, cats can be picky. For every cat that is easy to please, you’ll have another that is super-finicky about their environment. Placement of the litter box can cause elimination issues and could result in your cat preferring to use your bed as a litter box, rather than the litter box itself.</p><p>Cats tend to like privacy when they go to the bathroom. This is completely natural, as going to the bathroom makes them vulnerable to larger predators in the wild. Most cats will prefer their litter box to be placed in a low-traffic area where they can get their privacy. If you have your litter box in a high-traffic area that does not allow them any peace, this could be the reason they sneak off into the bedroom to do their business.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><ul><li><strong>What You Can Do</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes we just have to bend to the will of our cats. If litter box location is the problem, try to find a <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>quiet area</a> somewhere in the house to move it to. Giving your cat their privacy may be the solution you need to keep them off your bed. Once you locate a more ideal area for the litter box, be sure to introduce your cat to the new placement.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=4_The_Litter_Box_Is_not_Clean_Enough><span class=dhn>4.</span> The Litter Box Is not Clean Enough</span></h3><p>Our clean and tidy little felines don’t like to settle for less than what they deserve. If you have been slacking on getting the litter box cleaned up regularly, this could be your issue. Your cat wants a nice, clean area to do their business, stepping in their waste is not their preference and this can cause some cats to find alternative places to go.</p><ul><li><strong>What You Can Do</strong></li></ul><p>This is a simple issue to fix if you find this is the most likely cause for your cat’s new and very unwelcome bathroom habits. Simply clean the litter box out thoroughly, replace the old litter with new, fresh litter and introduce your cat to the cleanliness. Of course, make sure to keep up with regular litter box cleaning to keep this issue from happening in the future.</p><p>Wondering whether an enzymatic spray or deodorizing powder is better at fighting pet odors? Compare <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel=nofollow><strong>Hepper's Pet Stain & Odor Eliminator Spray</strong></a> to their <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel=nofollow><strong>Litter Deodorizer Powder</strong></a> to see which product is best for your deodorizing needs.</p><p><span>At Pet Keen, we’ve admired Hepper for many years, and decided to take a controlling ownership interest so that we could benefit from the outstanding products of this cool cat company!</span></p><h3 class=num-head><span id=5_There_Are_Not_Enough_Litter_Boxes_for_Your_Multi-Cat_Home><span class=dhn>5.</span> There Are Not Enough Litter Boxes for Your Multi-Cat Home</span></h3><p>Multiple cat households may find that they do not have a sufficient number of litter boxes in the home.&nbsp; It is recommended to have one litter box per cat in the home, plus one extra. Some cats will refuse to share their litter box with others and this may prompt them to start finding other places to relieve themselves. If you do not have at least one litter box per cat, this could be your issue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><ul><li><strong>What You Can Do</strong></li></ul><p>Since it is advised to have one litter box per cat in the household plus an additional one, make sure you have the right number of boxes you need for the cohort of kitties in your home. Make sure you introduce your cats to the newest litter box additions so that they are aware of their placement and hopefully you’ll have your icky problem solved.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=6_Size_or_Style_of_the_Litter_Box><span class=dhn>6.</span> Size or Style of the Litter Box</span></h3><p>This is another one of those times that the finicky tendencies of some cats may be the reason they are pooping on your bed. This also goes hand-in-hand with changes in the environment. As small as it may seem, a simple change in the type or even size of the litter box could be the underlying reason you’re always washing your sheets.</p><p>Some cats can transition litter boxes with no problem however, some will have more specific preferences. For example, some cats prefer hooded boxes for security while others prefer open boxes that don’t make them feel so trapped. You may notice your cat is having a hard time adjusting to a new top-entry litter box when they are used to walking right in. Larger cats may not be comfortable going in smaller-sized boxes, while kittens may need something smaller to start.</p><ul><li><strong>What You Can Do</strong></li></ul><p>If you just recently changed the style or size of your cat’s litter box and they suddenly began using your bed, you may need to consider the switch as the reason. No one will be able to pick up on your cat’s preferences better than you. This can take time, especially with new cat owners or cats that are new to the home. This may be the process of elimination but it’s worth trying different types of boxes until you find the perfect fit. If you recently changed the box type, consider switching back to the box they were comfortable with.</p><h3 class=num-head><span id=7_Litter_Type_or_Texture><span class=dhn>7.</span> Litter Type or Texture</span></h3><p>The type of litter is another factor that can play a larger role in a cat’s bathroom habits than you may imagine. After all, there are many different litter types and textures on the market today and it’s natural for cat lovers to try out different types to see what works best. Some cats may not like the feel, texture, or even smell of a new litter type.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><ul><li><strong>What You Can Do</strong></li></ul><p>If you recently swapped your litter for a different type or texture then noticed your cat going number two in the bed, you may have found your problem. Try switching the litter back to one that is comfortable for your cat or one that is similar. If you are unable to use that type of litter anymore, try out a different type, as there are many different kinds available including clay, silica, pine, paper, wheat, corn, and more. You will need to find one that works for both you and your precious kitty.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></p><h2><span id=Conclusion>Conclusion</span></h2><p>If your cat has recently picked up the habit of using your bed as a place to poop, you’re going to want this nightmare to end as soon as possible. Make sure you reach out to your veterinarian to ensure there are no underlying health issues that are causing the behavior. Finding the root cause can be a process of elimination but hopefully, now that you know the potential reasons, you can try and get this issue solved once and for all.</p><p><strong>See Also:</strong></p><p class="text-light-gray text-small">Featured Image Credit: Billion Photos, Shutterstock</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolam4prHNZ5qopV%2Bstbp5w6icrGWdrnqkrdNmp6inoGK8r3nMsmSbnZRk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./why-is-everyone-leaving-scooter-braun-reason-behind-losing-his-clients.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why is everyone leaving Scooter Braun?
