Kelly Welling recalled telling her 15-year-old son, "I'm proud of you. I love you." Wesley died in front of his sister on the birthday of their mother on Tuesday, April 18.</p><p>Kelly stated that she received the shocking news about Wesley's death from Hannah, her daughter who narrowly escaped from being mowed down by a Toyota Camry in Thousand Oaks. "I get the call from my daughter Hannah. There was an accident and he was unconscious and they were doing CPR and they did CPR the whole way to the hospital," Kelly said. "That is where he passed. By some miracle, my daughter wasn’t standing right next to him because it could have been both of them," she added, reported <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">New York Post</a>.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=#>'Everybody loved them': Shattered parents remember Chattooga teen footballers who died in car crash</a></p><p><a href=#>Jamiere Howard: Driver, 14, livestreams car crash that ends up killing her 8-year-old sister and 2 teens</a></p><h2 class=split>What happened on the day of the crash?</h2><p>On Tuesday, the 15-year-old boy and his sister along with other students of Westlake High School student were waiting for the bus when 24-year-old Austin Eis allegedly hit him with his car intentionally. According to authorities, Eis who is homeless previously went on a rampage at a Simi Valley Walmart. Two employees were attacked and one of them was stabbed in the incident. The slain boy's sister stated that she heard the car skidding, "and like everything happened so fast."</p><h2 class=split>'I’m expecting him to walk down the stairs and still hear his voice'</h2><p>Talking about the incident, Kelly said, "I’m just concerned about his sister because she witnessed the accident. I just can’t believe it’s real. I’m expecting him to walk down the stairs and still hear his voice."&nbsp;</p><p>"I said, ‘I’m proud of you. I love you. Have a good day,’ and that was the last thing I said to him," the grieving mom recalled. Kelly also said that a week ago her own sister died and now she is planning her son's funeral. With Hannah and her other son, Cody, Kelly went to the crash scene in front of the school. "Everybody loved him. I’m finding out how many more people loved him than I already knew about from this whole thing," Kelly said.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5WouabFjLCcpaSZo7Ruuc6mZKieXWaCbsXEmqlmp5yZeqO72GadmqyRobm6eceiq2aaqWKws63ZnptmnKKew6a%2BjKucnJmcocBussinmKVlp6S%2Fpb%2BMraZmq5%2Bj</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./wiz-khalifa-show-stopped-three-injured-indiana-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wiz Khalifa Show Stopped Due to Crowd Panic, 3 Injured">&larr;
