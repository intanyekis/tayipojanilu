He became both ATP and ITF's Player of the Year in 1989. After his successful career ended, Becker has engaged in numerous ventures, such as working in the field of poker.</p><p>At the peak of his career, Becker had amassed a reported <strong>$63 million</strong>. However, on <i>June 21, 2017,</i> he was declared bankrupt, and in <i>2019,</i> he was forced to auction off 82 collectibles from his personal collection. Boris makes headlines for his notorious personal life and has been in a relationship with many women. However, he has been married twice and has four children.</p><h2>Boris Becker's First Wife</h2><p>The German Ace, Becker 's first spouse, was <strong>Barbara Feltus Becker</strong>, a German-American designer, former actress, and model.

Their first son <strong>Noah Gabriel</strong> was born on <i>January 18, 1994,</i> and their second son, <strong>Elias Balthasar,</strong> was born on <i>September 4, 1999</i>.</p><h2>Reason Behind Boris and Barbara's Divorce</h2><p>After seven years of marriage, Becker asked Barbara for separation in <i>December 2000, </i>and he was granted a divorce on <i>January 15, 2001</i>. Barbara left for Florida after a woman who claimed to be pregnant with Becker's child contacted her.</p><p>Further, Becker stated in his autobiography that he admitted to his wife about having a one night stand while Barbara was pregnant with their second child. Following the divorce, Barbara received a <strong>$14.4 million</strong> settlement, their condo on Florida, and custody of their children.</p><h2>Second Wife-Lilly Becker</h2><p>In <i>February 2009,</i> Boris announced on a television show that he and <a href=#><strong>Sharlely "Lilly" Kerssenberg</strong></a> were to be married.
