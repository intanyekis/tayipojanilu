The actress, known for Divorce Court (1999), The Gary I Knew (2020) as well as Entertainment Tonight (1981). She was before married to Gary Coleman.</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shannon-price-age></span><span>Shannon Price Age</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Price is 35 years old as of 2020, she was born&nbsp; on 28 August 1985</strong> in the USA. She celebrates her birthday on August 28 every year and her birth sign is Virgo.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shannon-price-height></span><span>Shannon Price Height</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Price stands at a height of 5 feet 7 inches.</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shannon-price-family></span><span>Shannon Price Family</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Price was born and raised by her parents in&nbsp;the USA</strong>. <strong>She is a sister of Shawn Price, </strong>was an American football defensive end in the NFL for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Carolina Panthers, Buffalo Bills, and San Diego Chargers<strong>.</strong></p><p>Our efforts to find out more about her family came to no avail as no such information is publicly available. Thus, the identity of Price’s parents is still unclear.&nbsp; We will update this section once this information is available.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shannon-price-husband></span><span>Shannon Price Husband</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Price was married to Gary Coleman. The couple married in 2007 and divorced in 2008.</strong><strong>The two met on the set of the film Church Ball, where price was serving as an extra.</strong> On 2 May 2008, they made a well-publicized appearance on the show Divorce Court to air their differences in an attempt to save their marriage.</p><p>Nevertheless, they divorced in August 2008, and Coleman was granted an ex parte restraining order against Price to prevent her from living in his home when he was hospitalized after their divorce. According to a court petition later filed by Price, the pair continued to live together in a common-law marriage until his death.</p><p>However, a judge ultimately ruled against Price after hearing evidence that she carried on affairs along with other men during the time she claimed to be with Coleman, and “physically abused Coleman in public, led him around by the hand like a child and displayed no physical affection toward him in front of anyone”. In the yea 2007, Coleman was cited for misdemeanor disorderly conduct in Provo, Utah, after a “heated discussion” in public along with his wife.</p><p>After they were divorced, Coleman actually filed a restraining order against Shannon. Obviously, things had to be pretty bad for this to happen.<strong> Coleman died in 2010, he suffered a brain bleed after falling at his home.</strong> Many people have since suspected that he did not just fall, but that he was instead pushed.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=shannon-price-and-gary-coleman></span>Shannon Price and&nbsp; Gary Coleman<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Gary Coleman was an American actor, comedian, and writer who was born in Zion, Illinois, U.S. as Gary Wayne Coleman. He was one of the highest-paid child actors in the late 1970s and early 1980s, first he was rated on a list of VH1’s “100 Greatest Kid Stars” and received several accolades throughout his career, such as two Young Artist Awards and four People’s Choice Awards.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=shannon-price-ex-husband-gary-coleman></span>Shannon Price Ex-Husband Gary Coleman<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><strong>Coleman died at an age of 42 years old, he was born on 28 May 2010</strong> in Utah Valley Hospital, Provo, Utah, United States.
