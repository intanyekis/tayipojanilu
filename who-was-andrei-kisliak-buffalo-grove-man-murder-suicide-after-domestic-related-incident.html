Identified as the Kisliak family, the deceased lived at 2830 Acacia Terrace in a northwest suburb of <a href=# rel>Chicago</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Andrei Kisliak allegedly fatally stabbed his wife, two daughters, and a relative before killing himself on Wednesday, November 30. According to the Daily Mail, the shocking deaths are seemingly rooted in a <a href=# rel>domestic-related</a> incident that took place two months after his wife filed an order of protection against Andrei in September, as per court records.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Cops find family of 5 dead at Buffalo Grove home during wellness check in apparent murder-suicide</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Who are the Buffalo Grove victims?

The officers also discovered a dead animal inside the home. The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Lake McHenry Scanner</a>'s sources say that the 39-year-old killed himself after stabbing his wife, daughters, and relative.&nbsp;</p><p>In the press conference, the officers explained that they found the five dead while on a wellness check. They were called at around 11.10 am to a home in the northwest suburb for a welfare check on a woman citing that she had not reached work for a shift that was scheduled.</p><p>When the officers reached the place, they were not able to contact anyone in the home. On November 30, the Village of Buffalo Grove of Illinois announced on Twitter that "forced entry was deemed necessary + a sweep of the home was conducted." It was at this point that officers found the five family members dead.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Upon arrival, police were unable to make contact with anyone in the home. Forced entry was deemed necessary + a sweep of the home was conducted. Five deceased individuals were found. Preliminary investigation indicates a domestic-related incident w/ no threat to the public.

However, tracing back to events of legal orders and divorce petitions Vera filed against Andrei, their neighbors pointed out the proceedings the family has been involved in for the past few months.&nbsp;</p><p>As per the court documents obtained by the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Chicago Tribune</a>, Andrei had been charged with contempt of court on the same day Vera filed an order of protection wherein he was supposed to appear before the court on December 12. The couple was in the middle of the divorce proceedings, based on their filing in July.&nbsp;</p><p>The family was also going through a legal proceeding facing a foreclosure case on their home opened by a mortgage lender citing failure to make due payments since July 2020.</p><p>Lake County Clerk of the Circuit Court's representative referred to the multiple cases filed against Andrei in the past as closed. They also told Chicago Tribune that some of Andrei's court records are not available at present.</p><p>During the press conference on December 1, Chief Budds thanked the Buffalo Grove Police and Fire Departments' officers for their "service and dedication in handling this traumatic investigation." "I also would like to thank the Lake County Major Crime Task Force along with the Lake County Coroner's Office for their invaluable assistance with this investigation which remains active and ongoing," he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikerit0maYp5yimrZut8iso6KZm2KvtrLFmqOoZZenvLexjKaYp2Wdqr%2BlsdFmqq6hk56xpnnAn6ueql2ZvK6x0q2gnGWimrmiwMSdZKKmk56xprrT</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lisa-marie-presley.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="American Singer-Songwriter, Lisa Marie Presley Was Married For Fourth Times With Her Celebrity Husba">&larr;
